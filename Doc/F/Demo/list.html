Here are a few examples from a consolidated core of forms that can have paths for all jurisdictions and forms of all kinds.  It is early and imperfect. <br>
For a short list of some types of agreements, see <a href="index.php?action=list&file=F/US/00/Agt/">F/US/00/Agt/</a>.

The <a href="index.php?action=source&file=F/Demo/Agt_5Languages.md">F/Demo/Agt_5Languages.md</a> is a first cut at a generalized approach to agreement frames.  At root, agreements are a name, some parties, some reason, some Sections, signature and sometimes some Annexes.  The five language frame attempts to systematize this so that a single framework can handle all jurisictions using common formats of information about the participants.  It is also a brisk introduction to "classes" of persons - including "Human" (with subclasses of "She" and "He") and "Entity" (which needs subclasses such as "Corp", "Partnership," etc.).
