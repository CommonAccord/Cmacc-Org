Here are a few examples from a consolidated core of forms that can have paths for all jurisdictions and forms of all kinds.  It is early and imperfect. <br>
For a short list of some types of agreements, see <a href="i.php?v=l&f=F/US/00/Agt/">F/US/00/Agt/</a>.

The <a href="i.php?v=s&f=F/Demo/Agt_5Languages.md">F/Demo/Agt_5Languages.md</a> is a first cut at a generalized approach to agreement frames.  At root, agreements are a name, some parties, some reason, some Sections, signature and sometimes some Annexes.  The five language frame attempts to systematize this so that a single framework can handle all jurisictions using common formats of information about the participants.  It is also a brisk introduction to "classes" of persons - including "Human" (with subclasses of "She" and "He") and "Entity" (which needs subclasses such as "Corp", "Partnership," etc.).

In a completely different example, we show integration of "parameters, prose and code." (Grigg's Ricardian) <a href="http://www.commonaccord.org/i.php?v=d&f=bqc/fr/bnpp/a5we/Account/Check/00001/06-Accept.md">bqc (banque-chain for LaBChain)</a><br>
