Issue.Seed.Purchase.Sec=Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each investor listed as a "Purchaser" on Schedule 1 (a "Purchaser") agrees to purchase at the applicable Closing (as defined below) and the Company agrees to sell and issue to each Purchaser at such Closing that number of shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock of the Company ("Series Seed Preferred Stock") set forth opposite such Purchaser's name on Schedule 1, at a purchase price per share equal to the Purchase Price.
