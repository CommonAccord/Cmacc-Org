In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined in good faith by the Board.  Whether or not fractional shares would be issuable upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion.

Pref.Convert.Proc.Sec=<b>Mechanics of Conversion</b><ol><li>{Pref.Convert.Proc.Notice.Sec}</li><li>{Pref.Convert.Proc.Reserve.Sec}</li><li>{Pref.Convert.Proc.Effect.Sec}</li><li>{Pref.Convert.Proc.UndeclaredDividend.Sec}</li></ol>

Pref.Convert.Proc.Notice.Sec=<b>Notice of Conversion</b><br>In order for a holder of Preferred Stock to voluntarily convert shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates for such shares of Preferred Stock (or, if such registered holder alleges that any such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate), at the office of the transfer agent for the Preferred Stock (or at the principal office of the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent), together with written notice that such holder elects to convert all or any number of the shares of the Preferred Stock represented by such certificate or certificates and, if applicable, any event on which such conversion is contingent (a "Contingency Event").  Such notice shall state such holder's name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued.  If required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or such holder's attorney duly authorized in writing.  The close of business on the date of receipt by the transfer agent (or by the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent) of such certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) and notice (or, if later, the date on which all Contingency Events have occurred) shall be the time of conversion (the "Conversion Time"), and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares represented by such certificate shall be deemed to be outstanding of record as of such time.  The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after the Conversion Time, (a) issue and deliver to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to such holder's nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof and a certificate for the number (if any) of the shares of Preferred Stock represented by the surrendered certificate that were not converted into Common Stock, (b) pay in cash such amount as provided in Section {Pref.Convert.Fraction.Sec.Xnum} in lieu of any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion and (c) pay all declared but unpaid dividends on the shares of Preferred Stock converted.

Pref.Convert.Proc.Reserve.Sec=<b>Reservation of Shares</b><br>The Corporation shall at all times while any share of Preferred Stock shall be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued capital stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Stock, such number of its duly authorized shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then-outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall use its best efforts to cause such corporate action to be taken as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to this Restated Certificate.  Before taking any action that would cause an adjustment reducing the Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock below the then par value of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such series of Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take any corporate action that may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary so that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Price.

Pref.Convert.Proc.Effect.Sec=<b>Effect of Conversion</b><br>All shares of Preferred Stock that shall have been surrendered for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares shall immediately cease and terminate at the Conversion Time, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor, to receive payment in lieu of any fraction of a share otherwise issuable upon such conversion as provided in Section {Pref.Convert.Fraction.Sec.Xnum} and to receive payment of any dividends declared but unpaid thereon.  Any shares of Preferred Stock so converted shall be retired and cancelled and may not be reissued.

Pref.Convert.Proc.UndeclaredDividend.Sec=<b>No Further Adjustment</b><br>Upon any conversion of shares of Preferred Stock, no adjustment to the Conversion Price of the applicable series of Preferred Stock shall be made with respect to the converted shares for any declared but unpaid dividends on such series of Preferred Stock or on the Common Stock delivered upon conversion.

Pref.Convert.Split.Sec=<b>Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations</b><br>If the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the date on which the first share of a series of Preferred Stock is issued by the Corporation (such date referred to herein as the "Original Issue Date" for such series of Preferred Stock) effect a subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock, the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be proportionately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be increased in proportion to such increase in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding.  If the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date for a series of Preferred Stock combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately before the combination shall be proportionately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding.  Any adjustment under this Section {Pref.Convert.Split.Sec.Xnum} shall become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

Pref.Convert.CommonDividend.Numerator.cl=the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business on such record date

Pref.Convert.CommonDividend.Denominator.cl=the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution

Pref.Convert.CommonDividend.Cont.Para=Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is not fully paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, such Conversion Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date and thereafter such Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section {Pref.Convert.CommonDividend.Sec.Xnum} as of the time of actual payment of such dividends or distributions; and (ii) no such adjustment shall be made if the holders of such series of Preferred Stock simultaneously receive a dividend or other distribution of shares of Common Stock in a number equal to the number of shares of Common Stock that they would have received if all outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event.

Pref.Convert.OtherStockDividend.Sec=<b>Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions</b><br>In the event the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date for a series of Preferred Stock shall make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation (other than a distribution of shares of Common Stock in respect of outstanding shares of Common Stock), then and in each such event the holders of such series of Preferred Stock shall receive, simultaneously with the distribution to the holders of Common Stock, a dividend or other distribution of such securities in an amount equal to the amount of such securities as they would have received if all outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event.

Pref.Convert.Reclassification.Sec=<b>Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution</b><br>If at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date for a series of Preferred Stock the Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of such series of Preferred Stock is changed into the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock of the Corporation, whether by recapitalization, reclassification, or otherwise (other than by a stock split or combination, dividend, distribution, merger or consolidation covered by Sections {Pref.Convert.Split.Sec.Xnum}, {Pref.Convert.CommonDividend.Sec.Xnum}, {Pref.Convert.OtherStockDividend.Sec.Xnum} or {Pref.Convert.Merger.Sec.Xnum} or by Section {Pref.Liquid.Deem.Sec.Xnum} regarding a Deemed Liquidation Event), then in any such event each holder of such series of Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such stock into the kind and amount of stock and other securities and property receivable upon such recapitalization, reclassification or other change by holders of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such recapitalization, reclassification or change.

Pref.Convert.Merger.Sec=<b>Adjustment for Merger or Consolidation</b><br>Subject to the provisions of Section {Pref.Liquid.Deem.Sec.Xnum}, if there shall occur any consolidation or merger involving the Corporation in which the Common Stock (but not a series of Preferred Stock) is converted into or exchanged for securities, cash, or other property (other than a transaction covered by Sections {Pref.Convert.CommonDividend.Sec.Xnum}, {Pref.Convert.OtherStockDividend.Sec.Xnum} or {Pref.Convert.Reclassification.Sec.Xnum}), then, following any such consolidation or merger, provision shall be made that each share of such series of Preferred Stock shall thereafter be convertible, in lieu of the Common Stock into which it was convertible prior to such event, into the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation issuable upon conversion of one share of such series of Preferred Stock immediately prior to such consolidation or merger would have been entitled to receive pursuant to such transaction; and, in such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board) shall be made in the application of the provisions in this Section {Pref.Convert.Sec.Xnum} with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the holders of such series of Preferred Stock, to the end that the provisions set forth in this Section {Pref.Convert.Sec.Xnum} (including provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any securities or other property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of such series of Preferred Stock.

Pref.Convert.Certify.Sec=<b>Certificate as to Adjustments</b><br>Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section {Pref.Convert.Sec.Xnum}, the Corporation at its expense shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable but in any event not later than 15 days thereafter, compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to each holder of such series of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment (including the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property into which such series of Preferred Stock is convertible) and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based.  The Corporation shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the written request at any time of any holder of any series of Preferred Stock (but in any event not later than 10 days thereafter), furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a certificate setting forth (a) the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock then in effect and (b) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other securities, cash or property which then would be received upon the conversion of such series of Preferred Stock.

Pref.Convert.Mandatory.Sec=<b>Mandatory Conversion</b><br>Upon either (a) the closing of the sale of shares of Common Stock to the public in a firm-commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended or (b) the date and time, or the occurrence of an event, specified by vote or written consent of the Requisite Holders at the time of such vote or consent, voting as a single class on an as-converted basis (the time of such closing or the date and time specified or the time of the event specified in such vote or written consent is referred to herein as the "Mandatory Conversion Time"), (i) all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock, at the applicable ratio described in Section {Pref.Convert.Right.Ratio} as the same may be adjusted from time to time in accordance with Section {Pref.Convert.Sec.Xnum} and (ii) such shares may not be reissued by the Corporation.

Pref.Convert.Proc.Sec=<b>Procedural Requirements</b><br>All holders of record of shares of Preferred Stock shall be sent written notice of the Mandatory Conversion Time and the place designated for mandatory conversion of all such shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to Section {Pref.Convert.Mandatory}.  Unless otherwise provided in this Restated Certificate, such notice need not be sent in advance of the occurrence of the Mandatory Conversion Time.  Upon receipt of such notice, each holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall surrender such holder's certificate or certificates for all such shares (or, if such holder alleges that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate) to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice, and shall thereafter receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Section {Pref.Convert.Sec.Xnum}.  If so required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or such holder's attorney duly authorized in writing.  All rights with respect to the Preferred Stock converted pursuant to Section {Pref.Convert.Mandatory.Sec.Xnum}, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and vote (other than as a holder of Common Stock), will terminate at the Mandatory Conversion Time (notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender the certificates at or prior to such time), except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender of their certificate or certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) therefor, to receive the items provided for in the next sentence of this Section {Pref.Convert.Proc.Sec.Xnum}.  As soon as practicable after the Mandatory Conversion Time and the surrender of the certificate or certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) for Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall issue and deliver to such holder, or to such holder's nominee(s), a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof, together with cash as provided in Section {Pref.Convert.Fraction.Sec.Xnum} in lieu of any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion and the payment of any declared but unpaid dividends on the shares of Preferred Stock converted.  Such converted Preferred Stock shall be retired and cancelled and may not be reissued as shares of such series, and the Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Preferred Stock (and the applicable series thereof) accordingly.




Pref.Dividend.Sec=<b>Dividends</b><br>All dividends shall be declared pro rata on the Common Stock and the Preferred Stock on a pari passu basis according to the number of shares of Common Stock held by such holders.  For this purpose each holder of shares of Preferred Stock is to be treated as holding the greatest whole number of shares of Common Stock then issuable upon conversion of all shares of Preferred Stock held by such holder pursuant to Section {Pref.Convert.Sec.Xnum}.

Pref.Redeemed.Sec=<b>Redeemed or Otherwise Acquired Shares</b><br>Any shares of Preferred Stock that are redeemed or otherwise acquired by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries shall be automatically and immediately cancelled and retired and shall not be reissued, sold or transferred.  Neither the Corporation nor any of its subsidiaries may exercise any voting or other rights granted to the holders of Preferred Stock following redemption.

Pref.Waive.Sec=<b>Waiver</b><br>Any of the rights, powers, privileges and other terms of the Preferred Stock set forth herein may be waived prospectively or retrospectively on behalf of all holders of Preferred Stock by the affirmative written consent or vote of the holders of the Requisite Holders.

Pref.RecordDate.Sec=<b>Notice of Record Date</b> <br>In the event:

Pref.RecordDate.Dividend.cl=the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its Common Stock (or other capital stock or securities at the time issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock) for the purpose of entitling or enabling them to receive any dividend or other distribution, or to receive any right to subscribe for or purchase any shares of capital stock of any class or any other securities, or to receive any other security

Such notice shall be sent at least 20 days prior to the earlier of the record date or effective date for the event specified in such notice.
