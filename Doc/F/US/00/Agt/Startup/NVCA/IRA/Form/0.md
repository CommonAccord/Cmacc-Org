2.1.1.Ti=(a)	Form S-1 Demand

2.1.1.sec=If at any time after [the earlier of (i) [three (3) - five (5) years] after the date of this Agreement or (ii)] [one hundred eighty (180)] days after the effective date of the registration statement for the IPO, the Company receives a request from Holders of [_______ percent (___%)] of the Registrable Securities then outstanding that the Company file a Form S-1 registration statement with respect to [at least forty percent (40%)] of the Registrable Securities then outstanding [(or a lesser percent if the anticipated aggregate offering price, net of Selling Expenses, would exceed $[5-15] million)], then the Company shall (x) within ten (10) days after the date such request is given, give notice thereof (the “Demand Notice”) to all Holders other than the Initiating Holders; and (y) as soon as practicable, and in any event within sixty (60) days after the date such request is given by the Initiating Holders, file a Form S-1 registration statement under the Securities Act covering all Registrable Securities that the Initiating Holders requested to be registered and any additional Registrable Securities requested to be included in such registration by any other Holders, as specified by notice given by each such Holder to the Company within [twenty (20)] days of the date the Demand Notice is given, and in each case, subject to the limitations of Subsections 2.1(c) and 2.3.

2.1.3.sec=(c)	Notwithstanding the foregoing obligations, if the Company furnishes to Holders requesting a registration pursuant to this Subsection 2.1 a certificate signed by the Company’s chief executive officer stating that in the good faith judgment of the Company’s Board of Directors it would be materially detrimental to the Company and its stockholders for such registration statement to either become effective or remain effective for as long as such registration statement otherwise would be required to remain effective, because such action would (i) materially interfere with a significant acquisition, corporate reorganization, or other similar transaction involving the Company; (ii) require premature disclosure of material information that the Company has a bona fide business purpose for preserving as confidential; or (iii) render the Company unable to comply with requirements under the Securities Act or Exchange Act, then the Company shall have the right to defer taking action with respect to such filing[, and any time periods with respect to filing or effectiveness thereof shall be tolled correspondingly,] for a period of not more than [thirty (30) - one hundred twenty (120)] days after the request of the Initiating Holders is given; provided, however, that the Company may not invoke this right more than [once] in any twelve (12) month period[; and provided further that the Company shall not register any securities for its own account or that of any other stockholder during such [thirty (30) - one hundred twenty (120)] day period other than [an Excluded Registration] [Alternative: pursuant to a registration relating to the sale of securities to employees of the Company or a subsidiary pursuant to a stock option, stock purchase, or similar plan; a registration on any form that does not include substantially the same information as would be required to be included in a registration statement covering the sale of the Registrable Securities; or a registration in which the only Common Stock being registered is Common Stock issuable upon conversion of debt securities that are also being registered].

2.1.4.sec=(d)	The Company shall not be obligated to effect, or to take any action to effect, any registration pursuant to Subsection 2.1(a)(i) during the period that is [sixty (60)] days before the Company’s good faith estimate of the date of filing of, and ending on a date that is [one hundred eighty (180)] days after the effective date of, a Company-initiated registration, provided that the Company is actively employing in good faith commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective; (ii) after the Company has effected [one  - two] registration[s] pursuant to Subsection 2.1(a); or (iii) if the Initiating Holders propose to dispose of shares of Registrable Securities that may be immediately registered on Form S-3 pursuant to a request made pursuant to Subsection 2.1(b).  The Company shall not be obligated to effect, or to take any action to effect, any registration pursuant to Subsection 2.1(b) (i) during the period that is [thirty (30)] days before the Company’s good faith estimate of the date of filing of, and ending on a date that is [ninety (90)] days after the effective date of, a Company-initiated registration, provided that the Company is actively employing in good faith commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective; or (ii) if the Company has effected [two] registration[s] pursuant to Subsection 2.1(b) within the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the date of such request.  A registration shall not be counted as “effected” for purposes of this Subsection 2.1(d) until such time as the applicable registration statement has been declared effective by the SEC, unless the Initiating Holders withdraw their request for such registration, elect not to pay the registration expenses therefor, and forfeit their right to one demand registration statement pursuant to Subsection 2.6, in which case such withdrawn registration statement shall be counted as “effected” for purposes of this Subsection 2.1(d).

2.1.=[Z/ol-a/s4]

2.2.Ti=Company Registration

2.2.sec=If the Company proposes to register (including, for this purpose, a registration effected by the Company for stockholders other than the Holders) any of its [Common Stock][securities] under the Securities Act in connection with the public offering of such securities solely for cash (other than in an Excluded Registration), the Company shall, at such time, promptly give each Holder notice of such registration.  Upon the request of each Holder given within twenty (20) days after such notice is given by the Company, the Company shall, subject to the provisions of Subsection 2.3, cause to be registered all of the Registrable Securities that each such Holder has requested to be included in such registration.  The Company shall have the right to terminate or withdraw any registration initiated by it under this Subsection 2.2 before the effective date of such registration, whether or not any Holder has elected to include Registrable Securities in such registration.  The expenses (other than Selling Expenses) of such withdrawn registration shall be borne by the Company in accordance with Subsection 2.6.

2.3.Ti=Underwriting Requirements

2.3.1.sec=(a)	If, pursuant to Subsection 2.1, the Initiating Holders intend to distribute the Registrable Securities covered by their request by means of an underwriting, they shall so advise the Company as a part of their request made pursuant to Subsection 2.1, and the Company shall include such information in the Demand Notice.  The underwriter(s) will be selected by the [Company and shall be reasonably acceptable to a majority in interest of the Initiating Holders][Alternative: Initiating Holders, subject only to the reasonable approval of the Company].  In such event, the right of any Holder to include such Holder’s Registrable Securities in such registration shall be conditioned upon such Holder’s participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of such Holder’s Registrable Securities in the underwriting to the extent provided herein.  All Holders proposing to distribute their securities through such underwriting shall (together with the Company as provided in Subsection 2.4(e)) enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the underwriter(s) selected for such underwriting.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Subsection 2.3, if the [managing] underwriter(s) advise(s) the Initiating Holders in writing that marketing factors require a limitation on the number of shares to be underwritten, then the Initiating Holders shall so advise all Holders of Registrable Securities that otherwise would be underwritten pursuant hereto, and the number of Registrable Securities that may be included in the underwriting shall be allocated among such Holders of Registrable Securities, including the Initiating Holders, in proportion (as nearly as practicable) to the number of Registrable Securities owned by each Holder or in such other proportion as shall mutually be agreed to by all such selling Holders; provided, however, that the number of Registrable Securities held by the Holders to be included in such underwriting shall not be reduced unless all other securities are first entirely excluded from the underwriting.  [To facilitate the allocation of shares in accordance with the above provisions, the Company or the underwriters may round the number of shares allocated to any Holder to the nearest one hundred (100) shares.]

2.3.2.sec=(b)	In connection with any offering involving an underwriting of shares of the Company’s capital stock pursuant to Subsection 2.2, the Company shall not be required to include any of the Holders’ Registrable Securities in such underwriting unless the Holders accept the terms of the underwriting as agreed upon between the Company and its underwriters, and then only in such quantity as the underwriters in their sole discretion determine will not jeopardize the success of the offering by the Company.  If the total number of securities, including Registrable Securities, requested by stockholders to be included in such offering exceeds the number of securities to be sold (other than by the Company) that the underwriters in their reasonable discretion determine is compatible with the success of the offering, then the Company shall be required to include in the offering only that number of such securities, including Registrable Securities, which the underwriters and the Company in their sole discretion determine will not jeopardize the success of the offering.  If the underwriters determine that less than all of the Registrable Securities requested to be registered can be included in such offering, then the Registrable Securities that are included in such offering shall be allocated among the selling Holders in proportion (as nearly as practicable to) the number of Registrable Securities owned by each selling Holder or in such other proportions as shall mutually be agreed to by all such selling Holders.  [To facilitate the allocation of shares in accordance with the above provisions, the Company or the underwriters may round the number of shares allocated to any Holder to the nearest one hundred (100) shares.]  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall (i) the number of Registrable Securities included in the offering be reduced unless all other securities (other than securities to be sold by the Company) are first entirely excluded from the offering, [or] (ii) the number of Registrable Securities included in the offering be reduced below [twenty-thirty] percent ([20-30]%) of the total number of securities included in such offering, unless such offering is the IPO, in which case the selling Holders may be excluded further if the underwriters make the determination described above and no other stockholder’s securities are included in such offering [or (iii)  notwithstanding (ii) above, any Registrable Securities which are not Key Holder Registrable Securities be excluded from such underwriting unless all Key Holder Registrable Securities are first excluded from such offering.]  For purposes of the provision in this Subsection 2.3(b) concerning apportionment, for any selling Holder that is a partnership, limited liability company, or corporation, the partners, members, retired partners, retired members, stockholders, and Affiliates of such Holder, or the estates and Immediate Family Members of any such partners, retired partners, members, and retired members and any trusts for the benefit of any of the foregoing Persons, shall be deemed to be a single “selling Holder,” and any pro rata reduction with respect to such “selling Holder” shall be based upon the aggregate number of Registrable Securities owned by all Persons included in such “selling Holder,” as defined in this sentence.

2.3.3.sec=(c)	[For purposes of Subsection 2.1, a registration shall not be counted as “effected” if, as a result of an exercise of the underwriter’s cutback provisions in Subsection 2.3(a), fewer than [fifty percent (50%)] of the total number of Registrable Securities that Holders have requested to be included in such registration statement are actually included.]

The relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or allegedly untrue statement of a material fact, or the omission or alleged omission of a material fact, relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission; provided, however, that, in any such case (x) no Holder will be required to contribute any amount in excess of the public offering price of all such Registrable Securities offered and sold by such Holder pursuant to such registration statement, and (y) no Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation; and provided further that in no event shall a Holder’s liability pursuant to this Subsection 2.8(d), when combined with the amounts paid or payable by such Holder pursuant to Subsection 2.8(b), exceed the proceeds from the offering received by such Holder (net of any Selling Expenses paid by such Holder), except in the case of willful misconduct or fraud by such Holder.

4.1.6.sec=(f)	[Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, in lieu of complying with the provisions of this Subsection 4.1, the Company may elect to give notice to the Major Investors within thirty (30) days after the issuance of New Securities.  Such notice shall describe the type, price, and terms of the New Securities.  Each Major Investor shall have twenty (20) days from the date notice is given to elect to purchase up to the number of New Securities that would, if purchased by such Major Investor, maintain such Major Investor’s percentage-ownership position, calculated as set forth in Subsection 4.1(b) before giving effect to the issuance of such New Securities.

Note=If this provision is included in the Agreement, careful attention should be paid to the denominator used in the calculation of the pro rata participation right.  Note that this language will not work if Section 4.1 has been set up to give the investors a preemptive right.  See footnote 41.  The closing of such sale shall occur within sixty (60) days of the date notice is given to the Major Investors.]
