In connection with such purchase by the selling Key Holder, such Participating Investor or Investors shall deliver to the selling Key Holder any stock certificate or certificates, properly endorsed for transfer, representing the Capital Stock being purchased by the selling Key Holder (or request that the Company effect such transfer in the name of the selling Key Holder).
