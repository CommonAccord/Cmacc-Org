On the date of the occurrence of an Automatic Conversion Event, each holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, notwithstanding that the certificates representing such shares of Preferred Stock shall not have been surrendered at the office of the Corporation, that notice from the Corporation shall not have been received by any holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock, or that the certificates evidencing such shares of Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to such holder.

In the event the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock or a series of Preferred Stock shall be combined (by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of shares of Preferred Stock, the Original Issue Price and Liquidation Preference of the affected series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such combination shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination, be proportionately increased.

5.3.6.Ti=Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution

5.3.7.Ti=Certificate as to Adjustments

5.3.7.sec=Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 3, the Corporation at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based.
