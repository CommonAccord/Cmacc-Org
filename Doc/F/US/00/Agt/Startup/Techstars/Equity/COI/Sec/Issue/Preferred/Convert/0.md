Ti=CONVERSION RIGHTS

0.sec=The holders of the Series Preferred shall have the following rights with respect to the conversion of the Series Preferred into shares of Common Stock (the "Conversion Rights"):

1.Ti=Optional Conversion

1.sec=Subject to and in compliance with the provisions of this Section 5, any shares of Series Preferred may, at the option of the holder, be converted at any time into fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock.  The number of shares of Common Stock to which a holder of Series Preferred shall be entitled upon conversion shall be the product obtained by multiplying the "Series Preferred Conversion Rate" then in effect (determined as provided in Section 5(b)) by the number of shares of Series Preferred being converted by such holder.

2.Ti=Series Preferred Conversion Rate

2.sec=The conversion rate in effect at any time for conversion of the Series Preferred (the "Series Preferred Conversion Rate") shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the Original Issue Price of the Series Preferred by the "Series Preferred Conversion Price," calculated as provided in Section 5(c). 

3.Ti=Series Preferred Conversion Price

3.sec=The conversion price for the Series Preferred shall initially be the Original Issue Price of the Series Preferred (the "Series Preferred Conversion Price").  Such initial Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be adjusted from time to time in accordance with this Section 5.  All references to the Series Preferred Conversion Price herein shall mean the Series Preferred Conversion Price as so adjusted.


4.Ti=Mechanics of Conversion

4.sec=Each holder of Series Preferred who desires to convert the same into shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Section 5 shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the Series Preferred, and shall give written notice to the Company at such office that such holder elects to convert the same.  Such notice shall state the number of shares of Series Preferred being converted.  Thereupon, the Company shall promptly issue and deliver at such office to such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled and shall promptly pay (i) in cash or, to the extent sufficient funds are not then legally available therefor, in Common Stock (at the Common Stock's fair market value determined by the Board as of the date of such conversion), any declared and unpaid dividends on the shares of Series Preferred being converted and (ii) in cash (at the Common Stock's fair market value determined by the Board as of the date of conversion) the value of any fractional share of Common Stock otherwise issuable to any holder of Series Preferred.  Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the close of business on the date of such surrender of the certificates representing the shares of Series Preferred to be converted, and the person entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such shares of Common Stock on such date.

5.Ti=Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations

5.sec=If at any time or from time to time on or after the date that the first share of Series Preferred is issued (the "Original Issue Date") the Company effects a subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock without a corresponding subdivision of the Series Preferred, the Series Preferred Conversion Price in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be proportionately decreased.  Conversely, if at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date the Company combines the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares without a corresponding combination of the Series Preferred, the Series Preferred Conversion Price in effect immediately before the combination shall be proportionately increased.  Any adjustment under this Section 5(e) shall become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

6.Ti=Adjustment for Common Stock Dividends and Distributions

6.0.sec=If at any time or from time to time on or after the Original Issue Date the Company pays to holders of Common Stock a dividend or other distribution in additional shares of Common Stock without a corresponding dividend or other distribution to holders of Preferred Stock, the Series Preferred Conversion Price then in effect shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance, as provided below:  

6.1.0.sec=The Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Series Preferred Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction equal to:

6.1.1.sec=the numerator of which is the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance, and 

6.1.2.sec=the denominator of which is the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution;

6.1.=[Z/ol/s2]

6.2.sec=If the Company fixes a record date to determine which holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution, the Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be fixed as of the close of business on such record date and the number of shares of Common Stock shall be calculated immediately prior to the close of business on such record date; and 

6.3.sec=If such record date is fixed and such dividend is not fully paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date and thereafter the Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section 5(f) to reflect the actual payment of such dividend or distribution.

6.=[Z/ol/s3]

7.Ti=Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange, Substitution, Reorganization, Merger or Consolidation

7.sec=If at any time or from time to time on or after the Original Issue Date the Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series Preferred is changed into the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or otherwise (other than an Acquisition or Asset Transfer as defined in Section 4 or a subdivision or combination of shares or stock dividend provided for elsewhere in this Section 5), in any such event each holder of Series Preferred shall then have the right to convert such stock into the kind and amount of stock and other securities and property receivable upon such recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or other change by holders of the maximum number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series Preferred could have been converted immediately prior to such recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein or with respect to such other securities or property by the terms thereof.  In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 5 with respect to the rights of the holders of Series Preferred after the capital reorganization to the end that the provisions of this Section 5 (including adjustment of the Series Preferred Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Series Preferred) shall be applicable after that event and be as nearly equivalent as practicable.

8.Ti=Sale of Shares Below Series Preferred Conversion Price

8.1.0.sec=If at any time or from time to time on or after the Original Issue Date the Company issues or sells, or is deemed by the express provisions of this Section 5(h) to have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock (as defined below), other than as provided in Section 5(e), 5(f) or 5(g) above, for an Effective Price (as defined below) less than the then effective Series Preferred Conversion Price (a "Qualifying Dilutive Issuance"), then and in each such case, the then existing Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be reduced, as of the opening of business on the date of such issue or sale, to a price determined by multiplying the Series Preferred Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale by a fraction equal to:

8.1.1.sec=the numerator of which shall be (A) the number of shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding (as determined below) immediately prior to such issue or sale, plus (B) the number of shares of Common Stock which the Aggregate Consideration (as defined below) received or deemed received by the Company for the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at such then-existing Series Preferred Conversion Price, and 

8.1.2.sec=the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding (as determined below) immediately prior to such issue or sale plus the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued.

8.1.00.sec=For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be outstanding as of a given date shall be the sum of (A) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding, (B) the number of shares of Common Stock into which the then outstanding shares of Series Preferred could be converted if fully converted on the day immediately preceding the given date, and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock which are issuable upon the exercise or conversion of all other rights, options and convertible securities outstanding on the day immediately preceding the given date.

8.1.=[Z/ol/s2]

8.2.sec=No adjustment shall be made to the Series Preferred Conversion Price in an amount less than one cent per share.  Any adjustment required by this Section 5(h) shall be rounded to the nearest one cent ($0.01) per share. Any adjustment otherwise required by this Section 5(h) that is not required to be made due to the preceding two sentences shall be included in any subsequent adjustment to the Series Preferred Conversion Price.

8.3.sec=For the purpose of making any adjustment required under this Section 5(h), the aggregate consideration received by the Company for any issue or sale of securities (the "Aggregate Consideration") shall be defined as: (A) to the extent it consists of cash, be computed at the gross amount of cash received by the Company before deduction of any underwriting or similar commissions, compensation or concessions paid or allowed by the Company in connection with such issue or sale and without deduction of any expenses payable by the Company, (B) to the extent it consists of property other than cash, be computed at the fair value of that property as determined in good faith by the Board, and (C) if Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities (as defined below) or rights or options to purchase either Additional Shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities are issued or sold together with other stock or securities or other assets of the Company for a consideration which covers both, be computed as the portion of the consideration so received that may be reasonably determined in good faith by the Board to be allocable to such Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities or rights or options.

8.4.0.sec=For the purpose of the adjustment required under this Section 5(h), if the Company issues or sells (x) Preferred Stock or other stock, options, warrants, purchase rights or other securities convertible into, Additional Shares of Common Stock (such convertible stock or securities being herein referred to as "Convertible Securities") or (y) rights or options for the purchase of Additional Shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities, and if the Effective Price of such Additional Shares of Common Stock is less than the Series Preferred Conversion Price, in each case the Company shall be deemed to have issued at the time of the issuance of such rights or options or Convertible Securities the maximum number of Additional Shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise or conversion thereof and to have received as consideration for the issuance of such shares an amount equal to the total amount of the consideration, if any, received by the Company for the issuance of such rights or options or Convertible Securities plus:

Note=Something odd about the "; and" here: 

8.4.1.sec=in the case of such rights or options, the minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the exercise of such rights or options; and

8.4.2.sec=in the case of Convertible Securities, the minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the conversion thereof (other than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities); provided that if the minimum amounts of such consideration cannot be ascertained, but are a function of antidilution or similar protective clauses, the Company shall be deemed to have received the minimum amounts of consideration without reference to such clauses.

8.4.3.sec=If the minimum amount of consideration payable to the Company upon the exercise or conversion of rights, options or Convertible Securities is reduced over time or on the occurrence or non-occurrence of specified events other than by reason of antidilution adjustments, the Effective Price shall be recalculated using the figure to which such minimum amount of consideration is reduced; provided further, that if the minimum amount of consideration payable to the Company upon the exercise or conversion of such rights, options or Convertible Securities is subsequently increased, the Effective Price shall be again recalculated using the increased minimum amount of consideration payable to the Company upon the exercise or conversion of such rights, options or Convertible Securities. 

8.4.4.sec=No further adjustment of the Series Preferred Conversion Price, as adjusted upon the issuance of such rights, options or Convertible Securities, shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock or the exercise of any such rights or options or the conversion of any such Convertible Securities.  If any such rights or options or the conversion privilege represented by any such Convertible Securities shall expire without having been exercised, the Series Preferred Conversion Price as adjusted upon the issuance of such rights, options or Convertible Securities shall be readjusted to the Series Preferred Conversion Price which would have been in effect had an adjustment been made on the basis that the only Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued were the Additional Shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued or sold on the exercise of such rights or options or rights of conversion of such Convertible Securities, and such Additional Shares of Common Stock, if any, were issued or sold for the consideration actually received by the Company upon such exercise, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the Company for the granting of all such rights or options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration received for issuing or selling the Convertible Securities actually converted, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the Company (other than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities) on the conversion of such Convertible Securities, provided that such readjustment shall not apply to prior conversions of Series Preferred.

8.4.=[Z/ol/s4]


8.5.0.sec=For the purpose of making any adjustment to the Conversion Price of the Series Preferred required under this Section 5(h), "Additional Shares of Common Stock" shall mean all shares of Common Stock issued by the Company or deemed to be issued pursuant to this Section 5(h) (including shares of Common Stock subsequently reacquired or retired by the Company), other than:

8.5.1.sec=shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Series Preferred; 

8.5.2.sec=shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities issued after the Original Issue Date to employees, officers or directors of, or consultants or advisors to the Company or any subsidiary pursuant to stock purchase or stock option plans or other arrangements that are approved by the Board;

8.5.3.sec=shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the exercise of Convertible Securities outstanding as of the Original Issue Date;

8.5.4.sec=shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities issued for consideration other than cash pursuant to a merger, consolidation, acquisition, strategic alliance or similar business combination approved by the Board; 

8.5.5.sec=shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities issued pursuant to any equipment loan or leasing arrangement, real property leasing arrangement or debt financing from a bank or similar financial institution approved by the Board; 

8.5.6.sec=any Common Stock or Convertible Securities issued in connection with strategic transactions involving the Company and other entities, including (i) joint ventures, manufacturing, marketing or distribution arrangements or (ii) technology transfer or development arrangements; provided that the issuance of shares therein has been approved by the Board; and 

8.5.7.sec=shares with respect to which the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series Preferred, voting together as a separate class on an as-if-converted to Common Stock basis, have waived the anti-dilution rights provided for in this Section 5(h).

8.5.00.sec=References to Common Stock in the subsections of this clause (v) above shall mean all shares of Common Stock issued by the Company or deemed to be issued pursuant to this Section 5(h).  The "Effective Price" of Additional Shares of Common Stock shall mean the quotient determined by dividing the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock issued or sold, or deemed to have been issued or sold by the Company under this Section 5(h), into the Aggregate Consideration received, or deemed to have been received by the Company for such issue under this Section 5(h), for such Additional Shares of Common Stock.  In the event that the number of shares of Additional Shares of Common Stock or the Effective Price cannot be ascertained at the time of issuance, such Additional Shares of Common Stock shall be deemed issued immediately upon the occurrence of the first event that makes such number of shares or the Effective Price, as applicable, ascertainable.

8.5.=[Z/ol/s7]

8.6.sec=In the event that the Company issues or sells, or is deemed to have issued or sold, Additional shares of Common Stock in a Qualifying Dilutive Issuance (the "First Dilutive Issuance"), then in the event that the Company issues or sells, or is deemed to have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock in a Qualifying Dilutive Issuance other than the First Dilutive Issuance as a part of the same transaction or series of related transactions as the First Dilutive Issuance (a "Subsequent Dilutive Issuance"), then and in each such case upon a Subsequent Dilutive Issuance the Series Preferred Conversion Price shall be reduced to the Series Preferred Conversion Price that would have been in effect had the First Dilutive Issuance and each Subsequent Dilutive Issuance all occurred on the closing date of the First Dilutive Issuance.

8.=[Z/ol/s6]

9.Ti=Certificate of Adjustment

9.sec=In each case of an adjustment or readjustment of the Series Preferred Conversion Price for the number of shares of Common Stock or other securities issuable upon conversion of the Series Preferred, if the Series Preferred is then convertible pursuant to this Section 5, the Company, at its expense, shall compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the provisions hereof and shall, upon request, prepare a certificate showing such adjustment or readjustment, and shall mail such certificate, by first class mail, postage prepaid, to each registered holder of Series Preferred so requesting at the holder's address as shown in the Company's books.  The certificate shall set forth such adjustment or readjustment, showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based, including a statement of (i) the consideration received or deemed to be received by the Company for any Additional Shares of Common Stock issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold, (ii) the Series Preferred Conversion Price at the time in effect, (iii) the number of Additional Shares of Common Stock and (iv) the type and amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon conversion of the Series Preferred.  Failure to request or provide such notice shall have no effect on any such adjustment.

10.Ti=Notices of Record Date

10.sec=Upon (i) any taking by the Company of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution, or (ii) any Acquisition (as defined in Section 4) or other capital reorganization of the Company, any reclassification or recapitalization of the capital stock of the Company, any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into any other corporation, or any Asset Transfer (as defined in Section 4), or any voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company, the Company shall mail to each holder of Series Preferred at least ten (10) days prior to (x) the record date, if any, specified therein; or (y) if no record date is specified, the date upon which such action is to take effect (or, in either case, such shorter period approved by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Series Preferred) a notice specifying (A) the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend or distribution and a description of such dividend or distribution, (B) the date on which any such Acquisition, reorganization, reclassification, transfer, consolidation, merger, Asset Transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective, and (C) the date, if any, that is to be fixed as to when the holders of record of Common Stock (or other securities) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock (or other securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such Acquisition, reorganization, reclassification, transfer, consolidation, merger, Asset Transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up.

11.Ti=Automatic Conversion.

11.1.sec=Each share of Series Preferred shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock, based on the then-effective Series Preferred Conversion Rate, (A) at any time upon the affirmative election of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series Preferred, or (B) immediately upon the closing of a firmly underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the offer and sale of Common Stock for the account of the Company in which the gross cash proceeds to the Company (before underwriting discounts, commissions and fees) are at least $15,000,000 (a "Qualified IPO").  Upon such automatic conversion, any declared and unpaid dividends shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of Section 5(d).

11.2.sec=Upon the occurrence of either of the events specified in Section 5(k)(i) above, the outstanding shares of Series Preferred shall be converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion unless the certificates evidencing such shares of Series Preferred are either delivered to the Company or its transfer agent as provided below, or the holder notifies the Company or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates.  Upon the occurrence of such automatic conversion of the Series Preferred, the holders of Series Preferred shall surrender the certificates representing such shares at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the Series Preferred.  Thereupon, there shall be issued and delivered to such holder promptly at such office and in its name as shown on such surrendered certificate or certificates, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Series Preferred surrendered were convertible on the date on which such automatic conversion occurred, and any declared and unpaid dividends shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of Section 5(d).

11.=[Z/ol/s2]

12.Ti=Fractional Shares

12.sec=No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of Series Preferred.  All shares of Common Stock (including fractions thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of Series Preferred by a holder thereof shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the conversion would result in the issuance of any fractional share.  If, after the aforementioned aggregation, the conversion would result in the issuance of any fractional share, the Company shall, in lieu of issuing any fractional share, pay cash equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of one share of Common Stock (as determined by the Board) on the date of conversion.

13.Ti=Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion

13.sec=The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Series Preferred, such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of the Series Preferred.  If at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Series Preferred, the Company will take such corporate action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.

14.Ti=Notices

14.sec=Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 5 shall be in writing and shall be deemed effectively given: (i) upon personal delivery to the party to be notified, (ii) when sent by confirmed electronic mail or facsimile if sent during normal business hours of the recipient; if not, then on the next business day, (iii) five (5) days after having been sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or (iv) one (1) day after deposit with a nationally recognized overnight courier, specifying next day delivery, with verification of receipt.  All notices shall be addressed to each holder of record at the address of such holder appearing on the books of the Company.

15.Ti=Payment of Taxes

15.sec=The Company will pay all taxes (other than taxes based upon income) and other governmental charges that may be imposed with respect to the issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of shares of Series Preferred, excluding any tax or other charge imposed in connection with any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the shares of Series Preferred so converted were registered.
