Note=This file generates all the MSPA documents for a deal.  It lists the defined terms, the Term Sheet, then the document models, then puts them together into the SPA with its attachments.   To speed the presentation, at the bottom, we link to a fixed copy of the rendering.  This also is a way to lock-down a version.

Note=We get our Defined Terms:

Note=Here we put together the text, the SPA with Annexes.  All of the above except the Letter of Intent. For speed, the r00t (the starting point for all rendering) reference a pre-rendered version (the second line below).  The third line below is the outline of the original document, as rendered.
