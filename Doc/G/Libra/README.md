# Libra
Some documents from the Libra.Org initiative.

Libra.Org is a new initiative to create a global system of payments. It will have rules and governing documents that may have an impact on law and the social contract generally.  This repo is puts a few of their documents into Prose Object format to facilitate collaborative editing.

The repo is at github.com/CommonAccord/Libra.

It can be seen at http://www.commonaccord.org/index.php?action=list&file=G/Libra/

This repo is intended to be mounted as /G/Libra  - it depends on /Z/

There are currently two documents: the Association Council Principles and the White Paper.  The ACP is structured into sections - a /Form/ and /Sec/ with the /Intro/ and each of five sections /GoalPrinciple/, /Council/, /AssociationBoard/, /ImpactBoard/, and /Team/.
