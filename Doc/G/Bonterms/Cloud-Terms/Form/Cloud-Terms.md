To use the {_Bonterms_Cloud_Terms}, Customer and {_Provider} complete and execute a {_Cover_Page} that specifies {_Key_Terms}, {_Attachments} (such as a {_Support_Policy} or {_Data_Protection_Addendum}) and any {_Additional_Terms}. Collectively, the {_Bonterms_Cloud_Terms}, {_Cover_Page} and any {_Orders} form the parties’ agreement (“<b>{Def.Agreement}</b>”). Conflicts between parts of the {_Agreement} are governed by Section {Misc.DocumentHierarchy.Xnum} (Order of Precedence).
