# Bonterms Cloud Terms (Version 1.0)

**1. The Agreement**. The Bonterms Cloud Terms are standardized terms for use of cloud services. To use the Bonterms Cloud Terms, Customer and Provider complete and execute a Cover Page that specifies Key Terms, Attachments (such as a Support Policy or Data Protection Addendum) and any Additional Terms. Collectively, the Bonterms Cloud Terms, Cover Page and any Orders form the parties’ agreement (“**Agreement**”). Conflicts between parts of the Agreement are governed by Section 22.5 (Order of Precedence). Capitalized terms are defined in context or in Section 23 (Definitions).

**2. Cloud Service**. Subject to this Agreement, Customer may use the Cloud Service for its own business purposes during each Subscription Term (“**Permitted Use**”). This includes the right to copy and use the Provider Software (if any) and Documentation as part of Customer’s Permitted Use. Customer will comply with the Documentation in using the Cloud Service.

**3. Users**. Customer may permit Users to use the Cloud Service on its behalf. Customer is responsible for provisioning and managing its User accounts, for its Users’ actions through the Cloud Service and for their compliance with this Agreement. Customer will ensure that Users keep their login credentials confidential and will promptly notify Provider upon learning of any compromise of User accounts or credentials.

**4. Affiliates**. Customer’s Affiliates may serve as Users under this Agreement. Alternatively, Customer’s Affiliates may enter into their own Orders as mutually agreed with Provider, which creates a separate agreement between each such Affiliate and Provider incorporating this Agreement with the Affiliate treated as “Customer”. Neither Customer nor any Customer Affiliate has any rights under each other’s separate agreement with Provider, and breach or termination of any such separate agreement affects only that agreement.

**5. Data**.

**5.1. Use of Customer Data**. Subject to this Agreement, Provider will access and use Customer Data solely to provide and maintain the Cloud Service, Support and Professional Services under this Agreement (“**Use of Customer Data**”). Use of Customer Data includes sharing Customer Data as Customer directs through the Cloud Service, but Provider will not otherwise disclose Customer Data to third parties except as permitted in this Agreement.

**5.2. Security**. Provider will implement and maintain the **Security Measures** identified on the Cover Page. If no Security Measures are identified, Provider will use appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to prevent unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure of Customer Data.

**5.3. DPA**. The parties will adhere to the **Data Protection Addendum** (**DPA**), if any, identified on the Cover Page.

**5.4. Usage Data**. Provider may collect Usage Data and use it to operate, improve and support the Cloud Service and for other lawful business purposes, including benchmarking and reports. However, Provider will not disclose Usage Data externally unless it is (a) de-identified so that it does not identify Customer, its Users or any other person and (b) aggregated with data across other customers.

**6. Mutual Compliance with Laws**. Each party will comply with all Laws that apply to its performance under this Agreement.

**7. Support and SLA**.

**7.1. Support**. Provider will provide Support for the Cloud Service as described in the **Support Policy** on the Cover Page. If no Support Policy is identified, Provider will provide Support for the Cloud Service consistent with industry-standards and its general business practices.

**7.2. SLA**. Provider will adhere to the **Service Level Agreement** (**SLA**) identified on the Cover Page. If no SLA is identified, Provider will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Cloud Service available for Customer’s use 99.9% of the time in each month.

**8. Warranties**.

**8.1. Mutual Warranties**. Each party represents and warrants that:

(a) it has the legal power and authority to enter into this Agreement, and

(b) it will use industry-standard measures to avoid introducing Viruses into the Cloud Service.

**8.2. Additional Provider Warranties**. Provider warrants that:

(a) the Cloud Service will perform materially as described in the Documentation and Provider will not materially decrease the overall functionality of the Cloud Service during a Subscription Term (the “**Performance Warranty**”), and

(b) any Professional Services will be provided in a professional and workmanlike manner (the “**Professional Services Warranty**”).

**8.3. Warranty Remedy**. Provider will use reasonable efforts to correct a verified breach of the Performance Warranty or Professional Services Warranty reported by Customer. If Provider fails to do so within 30 days after Customer’s warranty report (“**Fix Period**”), then either party may terminate the Order as relates to the non-conforming Cloud Service or Professional Services, in which case Provider will refund to Customer any pre-paid, unused fees for the terminated portion of the Subscription Term (for the Performance Warranty) or for the non-conforming Professional Services (for the Professional Services Warranty). To receive these remedies, Customer must report a breach of warranty in reasonable detail within 30 days after discovering the issue in the Cloud Service or 30 days after delivery of the relevant Professional Services (“**Claim Period**”). These procedures are Customer’s exclusive remedies and Provider’s sole liability for breach of the Performance Warranty or Professional Services Warranty.

**8.4. Disclaimers**. **Except as expressly set out in this Agreement, each party disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and noninfringement. Provider’s warranties in this Section 8 do not apply to issues arising from Third Party Platforms or misuse or unauthorized modifications of the Cloud Service. These disclaimers apply to the full extent permitted by Law.**

**9. Usage Rules**.

**9.1. Compliance**. Customer (a) will comply with any **Acceptable Use Policy** (**AUP**) identified on the Cover Page and (b) represents and warrants that it has all rights necessary to use Customer Data with the Cloud Service and grant Provider the rights to Customer Data specified in this Agreement, without violating third-party intellectual property, privacy or other rights. Between the parties, Customer is responsible for the content and accuracy of Customer Data.

**9.2. High Risk Activities & Sensitive Data**. Customer:

(a) will not use the Cloud Service for High Risk Activities,

(b) will not submit Sensitive Data to the Cloud Service, and

acknowledges that the Cloud Service is not designed for (and Provider has no liability for) use prohibited in this Section 9.2.

**9.3. Restrictions**. Customer will not and will not permit anyone else to: (a) sell, sublicense, distribute or rent the Cloud Service (in whole or part), grant non-Users access to the Cloud Service or use the Cloud Service to provide a hosted or managed service to others, (b) reverse engineer, decompile or seek to access the source code of the Cloud Service, except to the extent these restrictions are prohibited by Laws and then only upon advance notice to Provider, (c) copy, modify, create derivative works of or remove proprietary notices from the Cloud Service, (d) conduct security or vulnerability tests of the Cloud Service, interfere with its operation or circumvent its access restrictions or (e) use the Cloud Service to develop a product that competes with the Cloud Service.

**10. Third-Party Platforms**. Customer may choose to enable integrations or exchange Customer Data with Third-Party Platforms. Customer’s use of a Third-Party Platform is governed by its agreement with the relevant provider, not this Agreement, and Provider is not responsible for Third-Party Platforms or how their providers use Customer Data.

**11. Professional Services**. Provider will perform Professional Services as described in an Order or Statement of Work, which may identify additional terms or milestones for the Professional Services. Customer will give Provider timely access to Customer Materials reasonably needed for Professional Services, and Provider will use the Customer Materials only for purposes of providing Professional Services. Subject to any limits in an Order or Statement of Work, Customer will reimburse Provider’s reasonable travel and lodging expenses incurred in providing Professional Services. Customer may use code or other deliverables that Provider furnishes as part of Professional Services only in connection with Customer’s authorized use of the Cloud Service under this Agreement.

**12. Fees**.

**12.1. Payment**. Customer will pay the fees described in the Order. Unless the Order states otherwise, all amounts are due within 30 days after the invoice date (the “**Payment Period**”). Late payments are subject to a charge of 1.5% per month or the maximum amount allowed by Law, whichever is less. All fees and expenses are non-refundable except as expressly set out in this Agreement.

**12.2. Taxes**. Customer is responsible for any sales, use, GST, value-added, withholding or similar taxes or levies that apply to its Orders, whether domestic or foreign (“**Taxes**”), other than Provider’s income tax. Fees and expenses are exclusive of Taxes.

**12.3. Payment Disputes**. If Customer disputes an invoice in good faith, it will notify Provider within the Payment Period and the parties will seek to resolve the dispute over a 15-day discussion period. Customer is not required to pay disputed amounts during the discussion period, but will timely pay all undisputed amounts. After the discussion period, either party may pursue any available remedies.

**13. Suspension**. Provider may suspend Customer’s access to the Cloud Service and related services due to a Suspension Event, but where practicable will give Customer prior notice so that Customer may seek to resolve the issue and avoid suspension. Provider is not required to give prior notice in exigent circumstances or for a suspension made to avoid material harm or violation of Law. Once the Suspension Event is resolved, Provider will promptly restore Customer’s access to the Cloud Service in accordance with this Agreement. “**Suspension Event**” means (a) Customer’s account is 30 days or more overdue, (b) Customer is in breach of Section 9 (Usage Rules) or (c) Customer’s use of the Cloud Service risks material harm to the Cloud Service or others.

**14. Term and Termination**.

**14.1. Subscription Terms**. Each **Subscription Term** will last for an initial 12-month period unless the Order states otherwise.

Provider, at its own cost, will defend Customer from and against any Provider-Covered Claims and will indemnify and hold harmless Customer from and against any damages or costs awarded against Customer (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) or agreed in settlement by Provider resulting from the Provider-Covered Claims.

**17.2. Indemnification by Customer**.

Trials and Betas may be inoperable, incomplete or include features never released. **Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, Provider offers no warranty, indemnity, SLA or Support for Trials and Betas and its liability for Trials and Betas will not exceed US$1,000.**

**22. General Terms**.

**22.1. Assignment**. Neither party may assign this Agreement without the prior consent of the other party, except that either party may assign this Agreement, with notice to the other party, in connection with the assigning party’s merger, reorganization, acquisition or other transfer of all or substantially all of its assets or voting securities.

**22.8. Waivers and Severability**. Waivers must be signed by the waiving party’s authorized representative and cannot be implied from conduct. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable, it will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so the rest of this Agreement remains in effect.

**22.9. Force Majeure**. Neither party is liable for a delay or failure to perform this Agreement due to a Force Majeure. If a Force Majeure materially adversely affects the Cloud Service for 15 or more consecutive days, either party may terminate the affected Order(s) upon notice to the other and Provider will refund to Customer any pre-paid, unused fees for the terminated portion of the Subscription Term. However, this Section does not limit Customer’s obligations to pay fees owed.

**22.10. Subcontractors**. Provider may use subcontractors and permit them to exercise its rights and fulfill its obligations, but Provider remains responsible for their compliance with this Agreement and for its overall performance under this Agreement. This does not limit any additional terms for subprocessors under a DPA.
