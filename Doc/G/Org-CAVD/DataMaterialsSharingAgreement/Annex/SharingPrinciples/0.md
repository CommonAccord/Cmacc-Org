Ti=DATA & MATERIALS SHARING GUIDING PRINCIPLES

0.sec=Collaboration for AIDS Vaccine Discovery in support of The {_Global_HIV_Vaccine_Enterprise}

1.Ti=DATA SHARING PRINCIPLES

1.1.Ti=Definitions

1.1.0.sec=For purposes of these Guiding Principles:

1.1.1.sec={Def.Non-_Standardized_Data} means all {_Data} not resulting from {_Standardized_Assay}s other than {_Comparative_Data}.

1.1.2.sec={Def.Standardized_Data} means all {_Data} resulting from an assay after it has been defined as a {_Standardized_Assay}; provided, however, to generate {_Standardized_Data}, the {_Standardized_Assay} must be performed by a person or organization that is certified to perform the {_Standardized_Assay} as determined by the {_Council_of_CAVD_PIs}.

1.1.3.sec={Def.Standardized_Assay}s mean a limited number of assays to be defined by the {_Council_of_CAVD_PIs}, in discussions with the {_Alliance_Manager} and the Foundation, as described in Section 1.e. below.

1.1.4.sec={Def.Comparative_Data} means all {_Data} resulting from comparative evaluation of Non- {_Standardized_Data} or {_Standardized_Data} produced by a {_CAVD_Member}.

1.1.5.sec={Def.Comparative_Standardized_Data} means all {_Data} resulting from comparative evaluation of {_Standardized_Data} produced by a {_CAVD_Member}; accordingly {_Comparative_Standardized_Data} is a subset of the {_Comparative_Data}.
Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in these Guiding Principles shall have the definitions as provided to them in Annex B to the {_CAVD} {_Data} & {_Material}s Sharing Agreement.

1.1.=[G/Z/ol-i/s5]

1.2.Ti=Inventions

1.2.1.sec=With respect to {_CAVD_Invention}s for which a patent is sought, inventorship will be determined by the law governing the jurisdiction in which the patent application is filed.

1.2.2.sec=Ownership of {_CAVD_Invention}s is outside the scope of these Guiding Principles and should be addressed by the {_CAVD_Member}s concerned under a separate contractual arrangement.

1.2.3.sec=To the extent not prohibited by law, regulation or third-party obligation (which obligation exists prior to the organization becoming a {_CAVD_Member}), each {_CAVD_Member} agrees to grant to the other {_CAVD_Member}s upon request a fully paid-up, non-exclusive, royalty free right-to-use all {_CAVD_Invention}s for purposes of education, as well as research, within a {_Funded_Center_or_Consortium} in support of the development of an HIV vaccine. To the extent such prospective grants by a {_CAVD_Member} are prohibited by law, regulation, or pre-existing third-party obligation, the relevant {_CAVD_Member} will in good faith seriously consider requests from {_CAVD_Member}s for the right to use such {_CAVD_Invention}s for such purposes and explore ways to enable such use on similar terms. The grant of the right to use provided under this paragraph does not waive any obligations under the {_CAVD_Master_CDA}, the {_CAVD_Master_MTA}, or other contractual arrangement between the {_CAVD_Member}s.

1.2.=[G/Z/ol-i/s3]

1.3.Ti=Management of {_Data}

1.3.1.sec=Management of {_Data} generated within a single {_VDC} will be determined by the terms of the agreements that govern that {_VDC}.

1.3.2.sec=The ownership of {_Data} is outside the scope of these Guiding Principles and should be addressed by the {_CAVD_Member}s under a separate contractual arrangement.

1.3.3.sec=No {_CSF} shall assert against any {_CAVD_Member} any database rights, copyrights, moral rights or other rights in the {_Data} incorporated into any database by a {_CSF} in support of the {_CAVD}. The {_CAVD_Member} that submitted {_Data} (or {_Material}s used to generate the {_Data}) to the {_CSF} shall not assert against any {_CAVD_Member}s any database rights, copyrights, or moral rights to such {_Data} incorporated into a database by a {_CSF} in support of the {_CAVD}.

1.3.=[G/Z/ol-i/s3]

1.4.Ti=Confidentiality of Information

1.4.sec=Subject to the provisions contained in these Guiding Principles, {_Confidential_Information} (as defined in the {_CAVD_Master_CDA}), including but not limited to {_Data}, that is shared between {_CAVD_Member}s of different {_Funded_Centers_or_Consortia} will be held in confidence according to the terms of a {_CAVD_Master_CDA}.

1.5.Ti=Treatment of {_Data}

1.5.1.0.sec=The {_Council_of_CAVD_PIs} will work with the {_Alliance_Manager} and the Foundation to:

1.5.1.1.sec=Approve the applicable VIMCâ€™s general process by which the VIMC exploratory assays generating {_Non-_Standardized_Data} may be redefined by the VIMC as {_Standardized_Assay}s.

1.5.1.2.sec=Determine the process by which {_Data} will be physically or electronically transferred among the {_Funded_Centers_or_Consortia}.

1.5.1.3.sec=Identify the position of the individual within each {_VDC} who shall be the primary contact person responsible for coordinating submission and receipt of {_Data} and/or {_Material}s to the {_CSF}s on behalf of such {_VDC} and its members.

1.5.1.=[G/Z/ol/s3]

1.5.2.sec=All {_Funded_Centers_or_Consortia} will work together with the VISC and, when required, the {_Alliance_Manager} and the Foundation, to establish statistical plans and data standards for each {_CAVD_Project} for which {_Data} is to be submitted to a {_CSF}, including the VISC, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations including (but not limited to) those related to data privacy and security. Prior to the initiation of any laboratory or statistical study by the VIMCs or VISC, the {_VDC} will work with the VIMC or VISC, as appropriate, to register the study with the VISC. {_VDC}s acknowledge the importance of consulting with the VISC regarding study design, as well as {_Data} organization and delivery, in order to facilitate the establishment of data standards and subsequent statistical analyses.

1.5.3.0.sec=With respect to all {_Non-_Standardized_Data} generated by a {_CSF} in the evaluation of a candidate vaccine, or components of a candidate vaccine:

1.5.3.1.sec=All {_Non-_Standardized_Data} generated on behalf of a {_VDC} will be transferred to the applicable {_VDC} within twenty (20) days following the production of the {_Non-_Standardized_Data}.

1.5.3.2.sec=The applicable {_VDC} will have discretion regarding whether and when {_Non-_Standardized_Data} (that is to be transferred to it according to the above paragraph 1) will be submitted to the VISC.

The {_Funded_Center_or_Consortium} that generated the Section e.v {_Data} will notify any other {_Funded_Center_or_Consortia} whose {_CAVD_Member}(s) provided the underlying {_Material} or {_Data} used to generate the Section e.v {_Data} when such Section e.v. {_Data} has been transferred to the VISC.

1.5.5.1.sec=All Section e.v {_Data} that is held or generated by the VISC will be transferred initially only to the {_Funded_Center_or_Consortium} whose member(s) provided the underlying {_Material}s or {_Data} used to generate the Section e.v {_Data}. Such transfer of the Section e.v {_Data} will be near real- time for rapid access by the applicable {_Funded_Center_or_Consortium} or at least within seven (7) days of generation by the VISC.

1.5.5.2.sec=The {_Funded_Center_or_Consortium} that provided the underlying {_Material} or {_Data} used to generate the Section e.v {_Data} will then have an exclusive review period of thirty (30) days from the date it receives the Section e.v {_Data}.

1.5.5.3.sec=Unless all of the applicable {_Funded_Centers_or_Consortia} provide their written permission sooner, at the end of that exclusive review period all of the Section e.v {_Data} will be disclosed to all of the other {_Funded_Centers_or_Consortia} by a mechanism established by the {_Alliance_Manager} with the {_Council_of_CAVD_PIs} and the Foundation. However, any member of the applicable {_Funded_Center_or_Consortium} shall be entitled to demand, via written notice submitted to the {_Alliance_Manager} before the end of such exclusive review period, that such disclosure be delayed for an additional sixty (60) days if necessary to evaluate whether to seek intellectual property protection of an invention that is disclosed in whole or in part by the Section e.v {_Data}.

1.5.5.4.sec=Upon disclosure to the other {_Funded_Centers_or_Consortia} in accordance with paragraph 3 above, the {_CAVD_Member}s agree to maintain the Section e.v {_Data} among themselves in confidence for a period of ninety (90) days after receipt, unless a longer period is otherwise established by the {_Council_of_CAVD_PIs} to enable the relevant {_Funded_Centers_or_Consortia} sufficient time to prepare such Section e.v {_Data} for Publication; provided, however, following the foregoing described ninety (90) day period, notwithstanding the {_Council_of_CAVD_PIs}, the {_CAVD_Member}s will be entitled to use such Section e.v {_Data} for the purpose of seeking additional grant or other research funding, although there may be a potential that the funding application might be {_Publish}ed. The {_Funded_Center_or_Consortia} whose member(s) provided the {_Material} and/or {_Data} used to generate the Section e.v {_Data} will then make reasonable efforts to disseminate such Section e.v {_Data} to the broader scientific community.

1.5.5.5.sec=When Section e.v {_Data} is {_Publish}ed or otherwise publicly disseminated outside the {_Funded_Centers_or_Consortia}, the entity with which the Section e.v {_Data} is shared will be required to acknowledge, in any of its subsequent Publications which use the Section e.v {_Data}, that the Section e.v {_Data} was generated through the activities of a {_CAVD_Project}.

1.5.5.6.sec=When Section e.v {_Data} is shared under an obligation of confidentiality outside the {_Funded_Centers_or_Consortia}, the entity with which the Section e.v {_Data} is shared will be required to acknowledge, in writing, that the Section e.v {_Data} was generated through the activities of a {_CAVD_Project} and will themselves adhere to the {_Global_Access_Objective}s with respect to its use of the Section e.v {_Data} and any invention arising out of the use of such Section e.v {_Data}.

2.Ti=MATERIALS SHARING PRINCIPLES

2.1.sec=The {_CAVD_Member}s acknowledge that they are strongly encouraged to share {_Material}s among themselves, but are under no obligation to do so. The {_CAVD_Member}s also acknowledge that their ability to share {_Material}s may be limited for various reasons, including the availability of the {_Material}s. The {_CAVD_MTA} shall define the terms, including the authorized use, of (i) the transfer of {_Material}s generated in the performance of a {_CAVD_Project} and (ii) the transfer of {_Material}s generated outside the {_CAVD_Project} but which are transferred for use within a {_CAVD_Project}.

2.2.sec=Ownership of {_Material}s is outside the scope of these Guiding Principles and should be addressed by the {_CAVD_Member}s under the relevant Material Transfer Record Form in the form attached to the {_CAVD_Master_MTA}.

2.3.sec={_Material}s must be collected, maintained and used in accordance with the necessary informed consent and regulatory approval (if applicable) in support of these Guiding Principles.

2.4.sec=Consistent with the strong encouragement of sharing, {_CAVD_Member}s shall use good faith efforts to submit {_Material}s that emanate from their evaluation (or an evaluation on their behalf) of a candidate HIV vaccine, or components of a candidate HIV vaccine, for comparative evaluation using {_Standardized_Assay}s.

2.5.sec=Where {_Material}s that are generated from the activities of a {_CAVD_Project} are shared outside the {_CAVD_Member}s, the non-{_CAVD_Member} entity with which the {_Material}s are shared will be required to acknowledge, in writing, that the {_Material}s were generated through the use of Foundation funding and such entity shall agree to adhere to the {_Global_Access_Objective}s with respect to its use of the {_Material} and any improvement, modification or invention in such {_Material}.

2.6.0.sec=With respect to the HSC:

2.6.1.sec=The {_CAVD_Member}s are strongly encouraged to deposit {_Material}s with the HSC;

2.6.2.sec=Within the framework of the {_CAVD_Master_MTA}, the HSC will develop mechanisms to share {_Material}s among the {_CAVD_Member}s and the broader scientific community with the permission of the {_Funded_Center_or_Consortium} whose member(s) provided the original {_Material}s; and

2.6.3.sec=If the organization that is serving in the role of HSC does not continue in that role or ceases to be a {_Funded_Center_or_Consortium}, the {_Council_of_CAVD_PIs}, in consultation with the {_Alliance_Manager} and the Foundation, will make a recommendation regarding the disposition of {_Material}s deposited with that organization, including possible transfer to another {_CSF} or to another organization that can fulfill role of HSC.

2.6.=[G/Z/ol-i/s3]

2.7.sec=The {_Funded_Centers_or_Consortia} will, on a semi-annual basis, provide a list of relevant {_Material}s that are potentially available for use by the {_CAVD_Member}s. The {_Council_of_CAVD_PIs} will, in consultation with the {_Alliance_Manager} and the Foundation, establish the mechanism for creating and updating a consolidated list of such {_Material}s.

2.=[G/Z/ol-a/s7]

3.Ti=UNIQUENESS OF IDENTIFIERS

3.sec=For bookkeeping purposes in order to ensure that {_Data} and {_Material}s generated or provided may be associated with the source {_CAVD} Center or Consortium, all {_Funded_Centers_or_Consortia} will comply with an identification naming convention that will be used across the {_CAVD} which will be established by the {_Council_of_CAVD_PIs} in consultation with the {_Alliance_Manager} and the Foundation; such identifiers shall be subject to the considerations identified in Section 1.e. Unique identifiers will be used to identify (consistent with applicable privacy laws and regulations) all {_CAVD_Member}s, investigators within the {_CAVD_Member}s, {_Material}, documents, and {_Data}, as well as transfers of {_Material}s, documents and {_Data} between {_CAVD_Member}s.
