When described as taking any action (including, without limitation, receiving notices or providing permissions), a {_Funded_Center_or_Consortium} will take such action through the {_CAVD_Project}’s Principal Investigator, unless the {_CAVD_Member}s within the {_Funded_Center_or_Consortia} decide otherwise (with notice of such decision to be provided to the Foundation and the {_Alliance_Manager}). All {_Funded_Centers_or_Consortia} (and its respective {_CAVD_Member}s) shall be listed on Annex A, which shall be updated by the {_Alliance_Manager} (and distributed to the Foundation and all then existing {_Funded_Center_or_Consortium}) as soon as possible upon a group commencing or ceasing its participation in the {_CAVD}.

15.sec={Def.Global_Access_Objective.sec}s means (i) the prompt dissemination of new scientific information within the {_CAVD}, across the Enterprise, and with the broader scientific community and (ii) facilitating the accessibility of future HIV vaccines to people most in need within developing countries.

16.sec={Def.Global_HIV_Vaccine_Enterprise.sec} means an alliance of independent organizations around the world dedicated to accelerating the development of a preventive HIV vaccine by (i) implementing a shared strategic plan for HIV vaccine research that spans vaccine discovery, product development and manufacturing, and clinical trials, (ii) mobilizing significant new funding to achieve the scientific plan, and (iii) promoting more efficient, faster ways for researchers to share successes and failures and avoid duplication of efforts, and as further described at www.hivvaccineenterprise.org.
