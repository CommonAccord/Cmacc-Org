Note=Here we demonstrate mixing clauses by including a library of Amendment clauses borrowed from other ProseObject documents. Click on the link to see some choices. 

Amend.=[S/Index/Sec/Contract/Misc/Amend.md]

Note=We then redirect the rendering of the Amendment clause to an item in the library, the Amendment clause from one of the TechContracts.com form agreements. 

Terms.Misc.Amend.sec=<b><i>{Amend.TechContracts.sec}</i></b>

Note=We then align defined terms from the target Amendment clause.

Amend._Agreement={_DPA}

Amend._party=party

Note=All of which are small overrides on the OneDPA agreement.  (Note that substantively, we haven't done much.  The Amendment section in the TechContracts is similar to the OneDPA section.  This just demonstrates the principle.)
