1. Relationship. 

This Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement (this “Agreement”) will apply to Service Provider’s relationship with the Company as a service provider and/or member.

The Company and Service Provider acknowledge that Service Provider may have performed work, activities, services or made efforts on behalf of or for the benefit of the Company, or related to the current or prospective business of the Company in anticipation of Service Provider’s involvement with the Company, that would have been “Services” if performed during the term of this Agreement, for a period of time prior to the Effective Date of this Agreement (the “Prior Service Period”). Accordingly, if and to the extent that, during the Prior Service Period: (i) Service Provider received access to any information from or on behalf of the Company that would have been Confidential Information (as defined below) if Service Provider received access to such information during the term of this Agreement; or (ii) Service Provider (a) conceived, created, authored, invented, developed or reduced to practice any item (including any intellectual property rights with respect thereto) on behalf of or for the benefit of the Company, or related to the current or prospective business of the Company in anticipation of Service Provider’s involvement with the Company, that would have been an Invention (as defined below) if conceived, created, authored, invented, developed or reduced to practice during the term of this Agreement; or (b) incorporated into any such item any pre-existing invention, improvement, development, concept, discovery or other proprietary information that would have been a Prior Invention (as defined below) if incorporated into such item during the term of this Agreement; then any such information shall be deemed “Confidential Information” hereunder and any such item shall be deemed an “Invention” or “Prior Invention” hereunder, and this Agreement shall apply to such activities, information or item as if disclosed, conceived, created, authored, invented, developed or reduced to practice during the term of this Agreement.

3. Service Agreement. 

Service Provider has entered into an operating agreement and/or service agreement with the Company on or about the date hereof regarding Service Provider’s membership in and/or services to the Company (the “Member Agreement”). The services rendered by Service Provider as a member pursuant to the Member Agreement are referred to herein as the “Services” and this Agreement is intended to supplement and form an integral part of any such Member Agreement(s).

4. Confidential Information.

(a) Protection of Information. 

Service Provider understands that during the Relationship, the Company intends to provide Service Provider with certain information, including Confidential Information (as defined below), without which Service Provider would not be able to perform Service Provider’s duties to the Company. At all times during the term of the Relationship and thereafter, Service Provider shall hold in strictest confidence, and not use, except for the benefit of the Company to the extent necessary to perform the Services, and not disclose to any person, firm, corporation or other entity, without written authorization from the Company in each instance, any Confidential Information that Service Provider obtains from the Company or otherwise obtains, accesses or creates in connection with, or as a result of, the Services during the term of the Relationship, whether or not during working hours, until such Confidential Information becomes publicly and widely known and made generally available through no wrongful act of Service Provider or of others who were under confidentiality obligations as to the item or items involved. Service Provider shall not make copies of such Confidential Information except as authorized by the Company or in the ordinary course of the provision of Services.

(b) Confidential Information. 

Service Provider understands that “Confidential Information” means any and all information and physical manifestations thereof not generally known or available outside the Company and information and physical manifestations thereof entrusted to the Company in confidence by third parties, whether or not such information is patentable, copyrightable or otherwise legally protectable. Confidential Information includes, without limitation: (i) Company Inventions (as defined below); and (ii) technical data, trade secrets, know-how, research, product or service ideas or plans, software codes and designs, algorithms, developments, inventions, patent applications, laboratory notebooks, processes, formulas, techniques, biological materials, mask works, engineering designs and drawings, hardware configuration information, agreements with third parties, lists of, or information relating to, employees and consultants of the Company (including, but not limited to, the names, contact information, jobs, compensation, and expertise of such employees and consultants), lists of, or information relating to, suppliers and customers (including, but not limited to, customers of the Company on whom Service Provider called or with whom Service Provider became acquainted during the Relationship), price lists, pricing methodologies, cost data, market share data, marketing plans, licenses, contract information, business plans, financial forecasts, historical financial data, budgets or other business information disclosed to Service Provider by the Company either directly or indirectly, whether in writing, electronically, orally, or by observation.

(c) Third Party Information. 

Service Provider’s agreements in this Section 4 are intended to be for the benefit of the Company and any third party that has entrusted information or physical material to the Company in confidence. During the term of the Relationship and thereafter, Service Provider will not improperly use or disclose to the Company any confidential, proprietary or secret information of Service Provider’s former clients or any other person, and Service Provider will not bring any such information onto the Company’s property or place of business.

(d) Other Rights. 

This Agreement is intended to supplement, and not to supersede, any rights the Company may have in law or equity with respect to the protection of trade secrets or confidential or proprietary information.

(e) U.S. Defend Trade Secrets Act. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the U.S. Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016 (“DTSA”) provides that an individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (iii) in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. In addition, DTSA provides that an individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual (A) files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and (B) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.

5. Ownership of Inventions.

(a) Inventions Retained and Licensed. 

Service Provider has attached hereto, as Exhibit A, a complete list describing with particularity all Inventions (as defined below) that, as of the Effective Date: (i) have been created by or on behalf of Service Provider, and/or (ii) are owned exclusively by Service Provider or jointly by Service Provider with others or in which Service Provider has an interest, and that relate in any way to any of the Company’s actual or proposed businesses, products, services, or research and development, and which are not assigned to the Company hereunder (collectively “Prior Inventions”); or, if no such list is attached, Service Provider represents and warrants that there are no such Inventions at the time of signing this Agreement, and to the extent such Inventions do exist and are not listed on Exhibit A, Service Provider hereby forever waives any and all rights or claims of ownership to such Inventions. Service Provider understands that Service Provider’s listing of any Inventions on Exhibit A does not constitute an acknowledgement by the Company of the existence or extent of such Inventions, nor of Service Provider’s ownership of such Inventions. Service Provider further understands that Service Provider must receive the formal approval of the Company before commencing Service Provider’s Relationship with the Company.

(b) Use or Incorporation of Inventions. 

If in the course of the Relationship, Service Provider uses or incorporates into any of the Company’s products, services, processes or machines any Invention not assigned to the Company pursuant to Section 5(d) of this Agreement in which Service Provider has an interest, Service Provider will promptly so inform the Company in writing. Whether or not Service Provider gives such notice, Service Provider hereby irrevocably grants to the Company a nonexclusive, fully paid-up, royalty-free, assumable, perpetual, worldwide license, with right to transfer and to sublicense, to practice and exploit such Invention and to make, have made, copy, modify, make derivative works of, use, sell, import, and otherwise distribute such Invention under all applicable intellectual property laws without restriction of any kind.

(c) Inventions. 

Service Provider understands that “Inventions” means discoveries, developments, concepts, designs, ideas, know how, modifications, improvements, derivative works, inventions, trade secrets and/or original works of authorship, whether or not patentable, copyrightable or otherwise legally protectable. Service Provider understands this includes, but is not limited to, any new product, machine, article of manufacture, biological material, method, procedure, process, technique, use, equipment, device, apparatus, system, compound, formulation, composition of matter, design or configuration of any kind, or any improvement thereon. Service Provider understands that “Company Inventions” means any and all Inventions that Service Provider or Service Provider’s personnel may solely or jointly author, discover, develop, conceive, or reduce to practice in connection with, or as a result of, the Services performed for the Company or otherwise in connection with the Relationship, except as otherwise provided in Section 5(g) below.

(d) Assignment of Company Inventions. 

Service Provider will promptly make full written disclosure to the Company, will hold in trust for the sole right and benefit of the Company, and hereby assigns to the Company, or its designee, all of Service Provider’s right, title and interest throughout the world in and to any and all Company Inventions and all patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights therein. Service Provider hereby waives and irrevocably quitclaims to the Company or its designee any and all claims, of any nature whatsoever, that Service Provider now has or may hereafter have for infringement of any and all Company Inventions. Any assignment of Company Inventions includes all rights of attribution, paternity, integrity, modification, disclosure and withdrawal, and any other rights throughout the world that may be known as or referred to as “moral rights,” “artist’s rights,” “droit moral,” or the like (collectively, “Moral Rights”). To the extent that Moral Rights cannot be assigned under applicable law, Service Provider hereby waives and agrees not to enforce any and all Moral Rights, including, without limitation, any limitation on subsequent modification, to the extent permitted under applicable law. If Service Provider has any rights to the Company Inventions, other than Moral Rights, that cannot be assigned to the Company, Service Provider hereby unconditionally and irrevocably grants to the Company during the term of such rights, an exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide, fully paid and royalty-free license, with rights to sublicense through multiple levels of sublicensees, to reproduce, distribute, display, perform, prepare derivative works of and otherwise modify, make, have made, sell, offer to sell, import, practice methods, processes and procedures and otherwise use and exploit, such Company Inventions.

(e) Maintenance of Records. 

Service Provider shall keep and maintain adequate and current written records of all Company Inventions made or conceived by Service Provider or Service Provider’s personnel (solely or jointly with others) during the term of the Relationship. The records may be in the form of notes, sketches, drawings, flow charts, electronic data or recordings, laboratory notebooks, or any other format. The records will be available to and remain the sole property of the Company at all times. Service Provider shall not remove such records from the Company’s place of business or systems except as expressly permitted by Company policy which may, from time to time, be revised at the sole election of the Company for the purpose of furthering the Company’s business. Service Provider shall deliver all such records (including any copies thereof) to the Company at the time of termination of the Relationship as provided for in Section 6 and Section 7.

(f) Intellectual Property Rights. 

Service Provider shall assist the Company, or its designee, at its expense, in every proper way in securing the Company’s, or its designee’s, rights in the Company Inventions and any copyrights, patents, trademarks, mask work rights, Moral Rights, or other intellectual property rights relating thereto in any and all countries, including the disclosure to the Company or its designee of all pertinent information and data with respect thereto, the execution of all applications, specifications, oaths, assignments, recordations, and all other instruments which the Company or its designee shall deem necessary in order to apply for, obtain, maintain and transfer such rights, or if not transferable, waive and shall never assert such rights, and in order to assign and convey to the Company or its designee, and any successors, assigns and nominees the sole and exclusive right, title and interest in and to such Company Inventions, and any copyrights, patents, mask work rights or other intellectual property rights relating thereto. Service Provider’s obligation to execute or cause to be executed, when it is in Service Provider’s power to do so, any such instrument or papers shall continue during and at all times after the end of the Relationship and until the expiration of the last such intellectual property right to expire in any country of the world. Service Provider hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as Service Provider’s agent and attorney-in-fact, to act for and in Service Provider’s behalf and stead to execute and file any such instruments and papers and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the application for, prosecution, issuance, maintenance or transfer of letters patent, copyright, mask work and other registrations related to such Company Inventions. This power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall not be affected by Service Provider’s subsequent incapacity.

(g) Exception to Assignments. 

Subject to the requirements of applicable state law, if any, Service Provider understands that the Company Inventions will not include, and the provisions of this Agreement requiring assignment of inventions to the Company do not apply to, any invention which qualifies fully for exclusion under the provisions of applicable state law, if any, attached hereto as Exhibit B. In order to assist in the determination of which inventions qualify for such exclusion, Service Provider will advise the Company promptly in writing, during and for a period of twelve (12) months immediately following the termination of the Relationship, of all Inventions solely or jointly conceived or developed or reduced to practice by Service Provider or Service Provider’s personnel in connection with, or as a result of, the Services performed for the Company during the period of the Relationship.

6. Company Property; Returning Company Documents. 

Service Provider acknowledges that Service Provider has no expectation of privacy with respect to the Company’s telecommunications, networking or information processing systems (including, without limitation, files, e-mail messages, and voice messages) and that Service Provider’s activity and any files or messages on or using any of those systems may be monitored or reviewed at any time without notice. Service Provider further acknowledges that any property situated on the Company’s premises or systems and owned by the Company, including disks and other storage media, filing cabinets or other work areas, is subject to inspection by Company personnel at any time with or without notice. At the time of termination of the Relationship, Service Provider will deliver to the Company (and will not keep in Service Provider’s possession, recreate or deliver to anyone else) any and all devices, records, data, notes, reports, proposals, lists, correspondence, specifications, drawings, blueprints, sketches, laboratory notebooks, materials, flow charts, equipment, other documents or property, or reproductions of any of the aforementioned items developed by Service Provider or Service Provider’s personnel pursuant to the Relationship or otherwise belonging to the Company, its successors or assigns.

7. Termination Certification. 

In the event of the termination of the Relationship, Service Provider shall sign and deliver the “Termination Certification” attached hereto as Exhibit C; however, Service Provider’s failure to sign and deliver the Termination Certification shall in no way diminish Service Provider’s continuing obligations under this Agreement.

8. Notice to Third Parties. 

During the periods of time during which Service Provider is restricted in taking certain actions by the terms of Section 9 of this Agreement (the “Restriction Period”), Service Provider shall inform any entity or person with whom Service Provider may seek to enter into a business relationship (whether as an owner, employee, independent contractor or otherwise) of Service Provider’s contractual obligations under this Agreement. Service Provider acknowledges that the Company may, with or without prior notice to Service Provider and whether during or after the term of the Relationship, notify third parties of Service Provider’s agreements and obligations under this Agreement. Upon written request by the Company, Service Provider will respond to the Company in writing regarding the status of Service Provider’s engagement or proposed engagement with any party during the Restriction Period.

9. Solicitation of Employees, Consultants and Other Parties. 

As described above, Service Provider acknowledges that the Company’s Confidential Information includes information relating to the Company’s employees, consultants, customers and others, and Service Provider will not use or disclose such Confidential Information except as authorized by the Company in advance in writing. Service Provider further agrees as follows:

(a) Employees, Consultants. 

During the term of the Relationship, and for a period of twelve (12) months immediately following the termination of the Relationship for any reason, whether with or without cause, Service Provider shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit any of the Company’s employees or consultants to terminate their relationship with the Company, or attempt to solicit employees or consultants of the Company, either for Service Provider or for any other person or entity.

(b) Other Parties. 

During the term of the Relationship, Service Provider will not influence any of the Company’s clients, licensors, licensees or customers from purchasing Company products or services or solicit or influence or attempt to influence any client, licensor, licensee, customer or other person either directly or indirectly, to direct any purchase of products and/or services to any person, firm, corporation, institution or other entity in competition with the business of the Company.

10. No Change to Duration of Relationship. 

Service Provider understands and acknowledges that this Agreement does not alter, amend or expand upon any rights Service Provider may have to continue in the relationship with the Company under any existing agreements between the Company and Service Provider, including without limitation the Member Agreement, or under applicable law.

11. Representations and Covenants.

(a) Facilitation of Agreement. 

Service Provider shall execute promptly, both during and after the end of the Relationship, any proper oath, and to verify any proper document, required to carry out the terms of this Agreement, upon the Company’s written request to do so.

(b) No Conflicts. 

Service Provider represents and warrants that Service Provider’s performance of all the terms of this Agreement does not and will not breach any agreement Service Provider has entered into, or will enter into, with any third party, including without limitation any agreement to keep in confidence proprietary information or materials acquired by Service Provider in confidence or in trust prior to or during the Relationship. Service Provider will not disclose to the Company or use any inventions, confidential or non-public proprietary information or material belonging to any previous client, employer or any other party. Service Provider will not induce the Company to use any inventions, confidential or non-public proprietary information, or material belonging to any previous client, employer or any other party. Service Provider shall not enter into any written or oral agreement that conflicts with the provisions of this Agreement.

Service Provider represents and warrants that Service Provider has listed on Exhibit A all agreements (e.g., non-competition agreements, non-solicitation of customers agreements, non-solicitation of employees agreements, confidentiality agreements, inventions agreements, etc.), if any, with a current or former client, employer, or any other person or entity, that may restrict Service Provider’s ability to perform the Services or Service Provider’s ability to recruit or engage customers or service providers on behalf of the Company, or otherwise relate to or restrict Service Provider’s ability to perform all applicable duties for the Company or any obligation Service Provider may have to the Company. Service Provider shall not enter into any written or oral agreement that conflicts with the provisions of this Agreement.

Service Provider further represents that Service Provider does not presently perform or intend to perform, so long as Service Provider is a party to the Member Agreement, consulting or other services for, and Service Provider is not presently employed by and has no intention of being employed by, companies whose businesses or proposed businesses in any way involve products or services that would be competitive with the Company’s products or services, or those products or services proposed or in development by the Company so long as Service Provider is a party to the Member Agreement. If, however, Service Provider decides to do so, Service Provider agrees that, in advance of accepting such employment or agreeing to perform such services, Service Provider will promptly notify the Company in writing, specifying the organization to which Service Provider proposes to render services, and provide information sufficient to allow the Company to determine if such work would conflict with the interests of the Company.

(c) Voluntary Execution. 

Service Provider certifies and acknowledges that Service Provider has carefully read all of the provisions of this Agreement, that Service Provider understands and has voluntarily accepted such provisions, and that Service Provider will fully and faithfully comply with such provisions.

12. Electronic Delivery. 

Nothing herein is intended to imply a right to participate in any of the Company’s equity incentive plans, however, if Service Provider does participate in such plan(s), the Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to Service Provider’s participation in the Company’s equity incentive plan(s) by electronic means or to request Service Provider’s consent to participate in such plan(s) by electronic means. Service Provider hereby consents to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agrees, if applicable, to participate in such plan(s) through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or a third party designated by the Company.

13. Miscellaneous.

(a) Governing Law. 

The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement, and all acts and transactions pursuant hereto and the rights and obligations of the parties hereto shall be governed, construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the state of Illinois, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law.

(b) Entire Agreement. 

Except as described in Section 3, this Agreement sets forth the entire agreement and understanding between the Company and Service Provider relating to its subject matter and merges all prior discussions between the parties to this Agreement. No amendment to this Agreement will be effective unless in writing signed by both parties to this Agreement. The Company shall not be deemed hereby to have waived any rights or remedies it may have in law or equity, nor to have given any authorizations or waived any of its rights under this Agreement, unless, and only to the extent, it does so by a specific writing signed by a duly authorized officer of the Company. Any subsequent change or changes in Service Provider’s duties, obligations, rights or compensation will not affect the validity or scope of this Agreement.

(c) Successors and Assigns. 

This Agreement will be binding upon Service Provider’s successors and assigns, and will be for the benefit of the Company, its successors, and its assigns.

(d) Notices. 

Any notice, demand or request required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed sufficient when delivered personally or by overnight courier or sent by email, or 48 hours after being deposited in the U.S. mail as certified or registered mail with postage prepaid, addressed to the party to be notified at such party’s address as set forth on the signature page, as subsequently modified by written notice, or if no address is specified on the signature page, at the most recent address set forth in the Company’s books and records.

(e) Severability. 

If one or more of the provisions in this Agreement are deemed void or unenforceable to any extent in any context, such provisions shall nevertheless be enforced to the fullest extent allowed by law in that and other contexts, and the validity and force of the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected. The Company and Service Provider have attempted to limit Service Provider’s right to use, maintain and disclose the Company’s Confidential Information, and to limit Service Provider’s right to solicit employees and customers only to the extent necessary to protect the Company from unfair competition. Should a court of competent jurisdiction determine that the scope of the covenants contained in Section 9 exceeds the maximum restrictiveness such court deems reasonable and enforceable, the parties intend that the court should reform, modify and enforce the provision to such narrower scope as it determines to be reasonable and enforceable under the circumstances existing at that time. In the event that any court or government agency of competent jurisdiction determines that, notwithstanding the terms of the Member Agreement specifying Service Provider’s Relationship with the Company, Service Provider’s provision of services to the Company is as an employee under the applicable laws, then solely to the extent that such determination is applicable, references in this Agreement to the Relationship between Service Provider and the Company shall be interpreted to include an employment relationship, and this Agreement shall not be invalid and unenforceable but shall be read to the fullest extent as may be valid and enforceable under the applicable laws to carry out the intent and purpose of this Agreement.

(f) Remedies. 

Service Provider acknowledges that violation of this Agreement by Service Provider may cause the Company irreparable harm, and therefore Service Provider agrees that the Company will be entitled to seek extraordinary relief in court, including, but not limited to, temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions and permanent injunctions without the necessity of posting a bond or other security (or, where such a bond or security is required, that a $1,000 bond will be adequate), in addition to and without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that the Company may have for a breach of this Agreement.

(g) Advice of Counsel. 

SERVICE PROVIDER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT, IN EXECUTING THIS AGREEMENT, SERVICE PROVIDER HAS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK THE ADVICE OF INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL, AND SERVICE PROVIDER HAS READ AND UNDERSTANDS ALL OF THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AGAINST ANY PARTY BY REASON OF THE DRAFTING OR PREPARATION HEREOF.

(h) Counterparts. 

This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, and all of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Execution of a facsimile or scanned copy will have the same force and effect as execution of an original, and a facsimile or scanned signature will be deemed an original and valid signature.
