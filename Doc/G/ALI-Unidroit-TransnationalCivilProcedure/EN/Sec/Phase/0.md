Ti=Structure of the Proceedings

1.sec=A proceeding ordinarily should consist of three phases: the pleading phase, the interim phase, and the final phase.

2.sec=In the pleading phase the parties must present their claims, defenses, and other contentions in writing, and identify their principal evidence.

3.0.sec=In the interim phase the court should if necessary:

3.1.sec=Hold conferences to organize the proceeding;

3.2.sec=Establish the schedule outlining the progress of the proceeding;

3.3.sec=Address the matters appropriate for early attention, such as questions of jurisdiction, provisional measures, and statute of limitations (prescription);

3.4.sec=Address availability, admission, disclosure, and exchange of evidence;

3.5.sec=Identify potentially dispositive issues for early determination of all or part of the dispute; and

3.6.sec=Order the taking of evidence.

3.=[G/Z/ol/s6]

4.sec=In the final phase evidence not already received by the court according to Principle {Phase.3.6.Xnum} ordinarily should be presented in a concentrated final hearing at which the parties should also make their concluding arguments.

Comment:

P-9A The concept of “structure” of a proceeding should be applied flexibly, according to the nature of the particular case. For example, if convenient a judge would have discretion to hold a conference in the pleading phase and to hold multiple conferences as the case progresses.

P-9B An orderly schedule facilitates expeditious conduct of the litigation. Discussion between the court and lawyers for the parties facilitates practical scheduling and orderly hearings. See Principle 14.2 and Comment P-14A.

P-9C Traditionally, courts in civil-law systems functioned through a sequence of short hearings, while those in common-law systems organized a proceeding around a final “trial.” However, courts in modern practice in both systems provide for preliminary hearings and civil-law systems have increasingly come to employ a concentrated final hearing for most evidence concerning the merits.

P-9D In common-law systems, a procedure for considering potentially dispositive issues before final hearing is the motion for summary judgment, which can address legal issues, or the issue of whether there is genuine controversy about facts, or both such issues. Civil-law jurisdictions provide for similar procedures in the interim phase.

P-9E In most systems the objection of lack of jurisdiction over the person must be made by the party involved and at an early stage in the proceeding, under penalty of forfeiting the objection. In international litigation it is particularly important that questions of jurisdiction be addressed promptly.
