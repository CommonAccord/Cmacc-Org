Comment:

P-31A International judicial cooperation and assistance supplement international recognition and, in modern context, are equally important.

P-31B Consistent with rules concerning communication outside the presence of parties or their representatives (ex parte communications), judges should, when necessary, establish communication with judges in other jurisdictions. See Principle 1.4.

P-31C For the significance of the term “evidence,” see Principle 16.
