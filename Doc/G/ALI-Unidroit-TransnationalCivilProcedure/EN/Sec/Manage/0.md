Comment:

P-14A Many court systems have standing orders governing case management. See Principle 7.2. The courtâ€™s management of the proceeding will be fairer and more efficient when conducted in consultation with the parties. See also Comment P-9A.

P-14B Principle 14.3 is particularly important in complex cases. As a practical matter, timetables and the like are less necessary in simple cases, but the court should always address details of scheduling.
