Title={Requesting_Party}-{Authorization_Server_Operator}: Supply-Truthful-Claims

Condition=When the {Authorization_Server} issues an {AAT} to a {Client} and for as long as the {AAT} is valid

Parties=the {Requesting_Party} using that {Client} gains an obligation to the {Authorization_Server_Operator}

Duty={Duty.1}

Duty.1=to supply or facilitate access to truthful claims required for access authorization at this {Authorization_Server}, when it chooses to supply them, to the best of its knowledge at the time it supplies them

Comments=At a later stage, the {Requesting_Party} might be asked to provide claims to support authorization processes at this {Authorization_Server} for accessing all resources protected by this {Authorization_Server}, managed by any Authorizing Parties, at any {Resource_Servers}. The {Requesting_Party}'s responsibility to act in good faith in interacting with this {Authorization_Server} begins now because factual claims it supplies could be reused for more than one access-sharing relationship. This obligation can be removed through {AAT} revocation.
