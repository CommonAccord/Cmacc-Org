(The Processor may stop Processing that Project Personal Data and delete it from its systems unless the Controller demonstrates that there is another legal basis for Processing that Project Personal Data, or that the Processing meets any other condition which justifies the Processing of Special Category Personal Data for the purposes of the Project, or that there are compelling legitimate grounds for the Processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the Data Subject, or that the Processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.);  

20.6	provide the Processor with such instructions regarding the Processing of the Project Personal Data as may be necessary to allow the processor to Process the Project Personal Data for the purposes of the Project and not give the Processor any unlawful instruction;
