20.5	if the legal basis for Processing any of the Project Personal Data or the condition to be met to justify the Processing of any Special Category Personal Data for the purposes of the Project is the Data Subject’s Consent, and that Consent is withdrawn, or if any Data Subject objects to any Processing of his or her Personal Data carried out by the Processor for the Controller or exercises his or her right to erasure or restriction or any other right under the Data Protection Legislation, as soon as possible, give notice of that withdrawal, objection or the exercise of that right and of the Project Personal Data affected to the Processor. (The Processor may stop Processing that Project Personal Data and delete it from its systems unless the Controller demonstrates that there is another legal basis for Processing that Project Personal Data, or that the Processing meets any other condition which justifies the Processing of Special Category Personal Data for the purposes of the Project, or that there are compelling legitimate grounds for the Processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the Data Subject, or that the Processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.);  

20.6	provide the Processor with such instructions regarding the Processing of the Project Personal Data as may be necessary to allow the processor to Process the Project Personal Data for the purposes of the Project and not give the Processor any unlawful instruction;
