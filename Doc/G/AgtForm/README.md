Multilingual basic frames for contract agreements.  /FR/, /PL/ and /US/, built on a shared frame of /00/.  

The basic framework for contract agreements.  Extended into a number of languages.

The idea is that the user - (e.g., a private user, or deux.commonaccord.org or commonaccord.org), mounts this repo in their own instance, based on the GitHub name.

So the user should mount this in /Doc/G/AgtForm.  You should be able then to pull and push to sync with GitHub version.

This is experimental, and letâ€™s see if it feels good.

Note=Uses of this can be seen across the website - for instance at:
