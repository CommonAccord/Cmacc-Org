7.Ti=Indemnity

7.sec={_Company} shall hold {_Customer} harmless from liability to third parties resulting from infringement by the Service of any United States patent or any copyright or misappropriation of any trade secret, provided {_Company} is promptly notified of any and all threats, claims and proceedings related thereto and given reasonable assistance and the opportunity to assume sole control over defense and settlement; {_Company} will not be responsible for any settlement it does not approve in writing. The foregoing obligations do not apply with respect to portions or components of the {_Service} (i) not supplied by {_Company}, (ii) made in whole or in part in accordance with {_Customer} specifications, (iii) that are modified after delivery by {_Company}, (iv) combined with other products, processes or materials where the alleged infringement relates to such combination, (v) where {_Customer} continues allegedly infringing activity after being notified thereof or after being informed of modifications that would have avoided the alleged infringement, or (vi) where {_Customer}’s use of the {_Service} is not strictly in accordance with this {_Agreement}. If, due to a claim of infringement, the {_Services} are held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be or are believed by {_Company} to be infringing, {_Company} may, at its option and expense (a) replace or modify the {_Service} to be non-infringing provided that such modification or replacement contains substantially similar features and functionality, (b) obtain for {_Customer} a license to continue using the {_Service}, or (c) if neither of the foregoing is commercially practicable, terminate this {_Agreement} and {_Customer}’s rights hereunder and provide {_Customer} a refund of any prepaid, unused fees for the {_Service}.

The provisions of this section allocate the risks under this {_Agreement} between the parties, and the parties have relied on the limitations set forth herein in determining whether to enter into this {_Agreement}.</span>

9.Ti=Miscellaneous

9.sec=If any provision of this {_Agreement} is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this {_Agreement} will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.

All waivers, amendments and modifications must be in writing signed by both parties, except as otherwise provided herein. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of this {_Agreement} and {_Customer} does not have any authority of any kind to bind {_Company} in any respect whatsoever.
