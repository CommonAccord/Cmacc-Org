Note=This page is an extension to the Chatham House model DSA.  It references the Chatham House DSA ("CH-DSA") and standard arbitration clauses from the International Chamber of Commerce ("ICC-Arb") and the American Arbitration Association ("AAA-Arb").  This allows us to extend the CH-DSA with standard arbitration solutions.  By clicking on "Document" above, the full CH-DSA form is rendered with a choice of the three alternatives.  The user would make a choice in the form of "Dispute.sec={ICC-Arb.MediationClauseC.sec}" or whichever of the ICC or AAA clauses they wanted.  We explain how this demo is put together:

Note=We "include" the CH-DSA:

=[G/ChathamHouseOrg/DataSharing/Form/0.md]

Note=We reference an assortment of possible standard clauses - including dispute resolution clauses from the ICC and the AAA arbitration associations as well as the original from the CH-DSA. 

CH-DSA-Dispute.=[G/ChathamHouseOrg/DataSharing/Sec/Misc/Dispute/0.md]

ICC-Arb.=[G/ICCWBO-Arbitration-EN-CmA/IntroductionAndClauses.md]

AAA-Arb.=[G/ADR-Org-CmA/0.md]

Note=We set up the substituton of the CH-DSA's dispute resolution clause (in its "Misc" section) with the three choices):

Misc.Dispute.sec={Dispute.sec}

Note=We use a widget for three alternatives and map the three alternatives:

Dispute.=[G/Z/Alt/3]

Dispute.Alt1.sec={CH-DSA-Dispute.sec}

Dispute.Alt2.sec={ICC-Arb.sec}

Dispute.Alt3.sec={AAA-Arb.Clause.sec}

Dispute.SecName=Dispute
