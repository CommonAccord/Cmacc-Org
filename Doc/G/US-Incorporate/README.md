This is an object-oriented approach to corporate legal documents.  This level of organization will have a /00/ folder for common structures and /DE/ /NY/ etc. folders for each state. Within each of those folders will be subfolders for each type of corporation.  Those will each contain subfolders for each of the types of documents used with that kind of corporate entity, for instance the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws.  We expect that there will also be folders for document sections and subcomponents, named as /Sec/.  

Currently, we have only examples for /DE/Stock/ and /DE/NonStock/.
