Proposal for a

REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
LAYING DOWN HARMONISED RULES ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
(ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ACT) AND AMENDING CERTAIN UNION
LEGISLATIVE ACTS

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 16
and 114 thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,

Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee1
,

Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank2
,

Having regard to the joint opinion of the European Data Protection Board and the European Data
Protection Supervisor,

Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions3
,

Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,
Whereas:

(1) The purpose of this Regulation is to improve the functioning of the internal market by
laying down a uniform legal framework in particular for the development, placing on the
market, putting into service and the use of artificial intelligence systems in the Union in
conformity with Union values, to promote the uptake of human centric and trustworthy
artificial intelligence while ensuring a high level of protection of health, safety,
fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter, including democracy and rule of law and
environmental protection, against harmful effects of artificial intelligence systems in the
Union and to support innovation. This regulation ensures the free movement of AI-based
goods and services cross-border, thus preventing Member States from imposing
restrictions on the development, marketing and use of Artificial Intelligence systems (AI
systems), unless explicitly authorised by this Regulation.

(1a) This Regulation should be applied in conformity with the values of the Union enshrined in
the Charter facilitating the protection of individuals, companies, democracy and rule of law
and the environment while boosting innovation and employment and making the Union a
leader in the uptake of trustworthy AI.

(2) AI systems can be easily deployed in multiple sectors of the economy and society,
including cross border, and circulate throughout the Union. Certain Member States have
already explored the adoption of national rules to ensure that artificial intelligence is
trustworthy and safe and is developed and used in compliance with fundamental rights
obligations. Differing national rules may lead to fragmentation of the internal market and
decrease legal certainty for operators that develop, import or use AI systems. A consistent
and high level of protection throughout the Union should therefore be ensured in order to
achieve trustworthy AI, while divergences hampering the free circulation, innovation,
deployment and uptake of AI systems and related products and services within the internal
market should be prevented, by laying down uniform obligations for operators and
guaranteeing the uniform protection of overriding reasons of public interest and of rights of
persons throughout the internal market based on Article 114 of the Treaty on the
Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). To the extent that this Regulation contains
specific rules on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data
concerning restrictions of the use of AI systems for remote biometric identification for the
purpose of law enforcement, for the use of AI systems for risk assessments of natural
persons for the purpose of law enforcement and for the use of AI systems of biometric
categorization for the purpose of law enforcement, it is appropriate to base this Regulation,
in as far as those specific rules are concerned, on Article 16 of the TFEU. In light of those
specific rules and the recourse to Article 16 TFEU, it is appropriate to consult the
European Data Protection Board.

(3) Artificial intelligence is a fast evolving family of technologies that contributes to a wide
array of economic, environmental and societal benefits across the entire spectrum of
industries and social activities. By improving prediction, optimising operations and
resource allocation, and personalising digital solutions available for individuals and
organisations, the use of artificial intelligence can provide key competitive advantages to
companies and support socially and environmentally beneficial outcomes, for example in
healthcare, farming, food safety, education and training, media, sports, culture,
infrastructure management, energy, transport and logistics, public services, security,
justice, resource and energy efficiency, environmental monitoring, the conservation and
restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems and climate change mitigation and adaptation .

(4) At the same time, depending on the circumstances regarding its specific application, use,
and level of technological development, artificial intelligence may generate risks and cause
harm to public interests and fundamental rights that are protected by Union law. Such harm
might be material or immaterial, including physical, psychological, societal or economic
harm.

(4a) Given the major impact that artificial intelligence can have on society and the need to build
trust, it is vital for artificial intelligence and its regulatory framework to be developed
according to Union values enshrined in Article 2 TEU, the fundamental rights and
freedoms enshrined in the Treaties, the Charter. As a pre-requisite, artificial intelligence
should be a human-centric technology. It should serve as a tool for people, with the
ultimate aim of increasing human well-being.

(4aa) In order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of public interests as
regards health, safety and fundamental rights, common rules for all high-risk AI systems
should be established. Those rules should be consistent with the Charter of fundamental
rights of the European Union (the Charter) and should be non-discriminatory and in line
with the Union’s international trade commitments. They should also take into account the
European Declaration on Digital Rights and Principles for the Digital Decade (2023/C
23/01) and the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) of the HighLevel Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence.

(5) A Union legal framework laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence is
therefore needed to foster the development, use and uptake of artificial intelligence in the
internal market that at the same time meets a high level of protection of public interests,
such as health and safety and the protection of fundamental rights, including democracy, 
rule of law and environmental protection as recognised and protected by Union law. To
achieve that objective, rules regulating the placing on the market, putting into service and
use of certain AI systems should be laid down, thus ensuring the smooth functioning of the
internal market and allowing those systems to benefit from the principle of free movement
of goods and services. These rules should be clear and robust in protecting fundamental
rights, supportive of new innovative solutions, enabling to a European ecosystem of public
and private actors creating AI systems in line with Union values and unlocking the
potential of the digital transformation across all regions of the Union. By laying down
those rules as well as measures in support of innovation with a particular focus on SMEs
including startups, this Regulation supports the objective of promoting the European
human-centric approach to AI and being a global leader in the development of secure,
trustworthy and ethical artificial intelligence as stated by the European Council4
, and it
ensures the protection of ethical principles, as specifically requested by the the European
Parliament5
.

(5a) The harmonised rules on the placing on the market, putting into service and use of AI
systems laid down in this Regulation should apply across sectors and, in line with its New
Legislative Framework approach, should be without prejudice to existing Union law,
notably on data protection, consumer protection, fundamental rights, employment, and
protection of workers, and product safety, to which this Regulation is complementary. As a
consequence all rights and remedies provided for by such Union law to consumers, and
other persons who may be negatively impacted by AI systems, including as regards the
compensation of possible damages pursuant to Council Directive 85/374/EEC of 25 July
1985 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the
Member States concerning liability for defective products, remain unaffected and fully
applicable. Furthermore, in the context of employment and protection of workers, this
Regulation should therefore not affect Union law on social policy and national labour law,
in compliance with Union law, concerning employment and working conditions, including
health and safety at work and the relationship between employers and workers. This
Regulation should also not affect the exercise of fundamental rights as recognised in the
Member States and at Union level, including the right or freedom to strike or to take other
action covered by the specific industrial relations systems in Member States as well as, the
right to negotiate, to conclude and enforce collective agreements or to take collective
action in accordance with national law. [This Regulation should not affect the provisions
aiming to improve working conditions in platform work set out in Directive ... [COD
2021/414/EC]] On top of that, this Regulation aims to strengthen the effectiveness of such
existing rights and remedies by establishing specific requirements and obligations,
including in respect of transparency, technical documentation and record-keeping of AI
systems. Furthermore, the obligations placed on various operators involved in the AI value
chain under this Regulation should apply without prejudice to national laws, in compliance
with Union law, having the effect of limiting the use of certain AI systems where such
laws fall outside the scope of this Regulation or pursue other legitimate public interest
objectives than those pursued by this Regulation. For example, national labour law and the
laws on the protection of minors (i.e. persons below the age of 18) taking into account the
United Nations General Comment No 25 (2021) on children’s rights, insofar as they are
not specific to AI systems and pursue other legimitate public interest objectives, should not
be affected by this Regulation.

(5aa) The fundamental right to the protection of personal data is safeguarded in particular
by Regulations (EU) 2016/679 and (EU) 2018/1725 and Directive 2016/680. Directive
2002/58/EC additionally protects private life and the confidentiality of communications,
including by way of providing conditions for any personal and non-personal data storing in
and access from terminal equipment. Those Union legal acts provide the basis for
sustainable and responsible data processing, including where datasets include a mix of
personal and non-personal data. This Regulation does not seek to affect the application of
existing Union law governing the processing of personal data, including the tasks and
powers of the independent supervisory authorities competent to monitor compliance with
those instruments.

It also does not affect the obligations of providers and deployers of AI systems in their role
as data controllers or processors stemming from national or Union law on the protection of
personal data in so far as the design, the development or the use of AI systems involves the
processing of personal data. It is also appropriate to clarify that data subjects continue to
enjoy all the rights and guarantees awarded to them by such Union law, including the
rights related to solely automated individual decision-making, including profiling.
Harmonised rules for the placing on the market, the putting into service and the use of AI
systems established under this Regulation should facilitate the effective implementation
and enable the exercise of the data subjects’ rights and other remedies guaranteed under 
Union law on the protection of personal data and of other fundamental rights.

(5ab) This Regulation should be without prejudice to the provisions regarding the liability
of intermediary service providers set out in Directive 2000/31/EC of the European
Parliament and of the Council [as amended by the Digital Services Act].

(6) The notion of AI system in this Regulation should be clearly defined and closely aligned
with the work of international organisations working on artificial intelligence to ensure
legal certainty, facilitate international convergence and wide acceptance, while providing
the flexibility to accommodate the rapid technological developments in this field.
Moreover, it should be based on key characteristics of artificial intelligence systems, that
distinguish it from simpler traditional software systems or programming approaches and
should not cover systems that are based on the rules defined solely by natural persons to
automatically execute operations. A key characteristic of AI systems is their capability to
infer. This inference refers to the process of obtaining the outputs, such as predictions,
content, recommendations, or decisions, which can influence physical and virtual
environments and to a capability of AI systems to derive models and/or algorithms from
inputs/data. The techniques that enable inference while building an AI system include
machine learning approaches that learn from data how to achieve certain objectives; and
logic- and knowledge-based approaches that infer from encoded knowledge or symbolic
representation of the task to be solved. The capacity of an AI system to infer goes beyond
basic data processing, enable learning, reasoning or modelling.
The term “machine-based” refers to the fact that AI systems run on machines. The
reference to explicit or implicit objectives underscores that AI systems can operate
according to explicit defined objectives or to implicit objectives. The objectives of the AI
system may be different from the intended purpose of the AI system in a specific context.
For the purposes of this Regulation, environments should be understood as the contexts in
which the AI systems operate, whereas outputs generated by the AI system, reflect
different functions performed by AI systems and include predictions, content,
recommendations or decisions.

AI systems are designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy, meaning that they
have some degree of independence of actions from human involvement and of capabilities
to operate without human intervention. The adaptiveness that an AI system could exhibit
after deployment, refers to self-learning capabilities, allowing the system to change while
in use. AI systems can be used on a stand-alone basis or as a component of a product, 
irrespective of whether the system is physically integrated into the product (embedded) or
serve the functionality of the product without being integrated therein (non-embedded).

(6a) The notion of ‘deployer’ referred to in this Regulation should be interpreted as any natural
or legal person, including a public authority, agency or other body, using an AI system
under its authority, except where the AI system is used in the course of a personal non
professional activity. Depending on the type of AI system, the use of the system may affect
persons other than the deployer.

(7) The notion of biometric data used in this Regulation should be interpreted in light of the
notion of biometric data as defined in Article 4(14) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the
European Parliament and of the Council 6
, Article 3(18) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of
the European Parliament and of the Council 7
 and Article 3(13) of Directive (EU)
2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council 8
.Biometric data can allow for the
authentication, identification or categorisation of natural persons and for the recognition of
emotions of natural persons.

(7a) The notion of biometric identification as used in this Regulation should be defined as the
automated recognition of physical, physiological and behavioural human features such as
the face, eye movement, body shape, voice, prosody, gait, posture, heart rate, blood
pressure, odour, keystrokes characteristics, for the purpose of establishing an individual’s
identity by comparing biometric data of that individual to stored biometric data of
individuals in a reference database, irrespective of whether the individual has given its
consent or not. This excludes AI systems intended to be used for biometric verification,
which includes authentication, whose sole purpose is to confirm that a specific natural
person is the person he or she claims to be and to confirm the identity of a natural person
for the sole purpose of having access to a service, unlocking a device or having security
access to premises.

(7b) The notion of biometric categorisation as used in this Regulation should be defined as
assigning natural persons to specific categories on the basis of their biometric data. Such
specific categories can relate to aspects such as sex, age, hair colour, eye colour, tattoos,
behavioural or personality traits, language, religion, membership of a national minority,
sexual or political orientation. This does not include biometric categorization systems that
are a purely ancillary feature intrinsically linked to another commercial service meaning
that the feature cannot, for objective technical reasons, be used without the principal
service and the integration of that feature or functionality is not a means to circumvent the
applicability of the rules of this Regulation. For example, filters categorizing facial or body
features used on online marketplaces could constitute such an ancillary feature as they can
only be used in relation to the principal service which consists in selling a product by
allowing the consumer to preview the display of the product on him or herself and help the
consumer to make a purchase decision. Filters used on online social network services
which categorise facial or body features to allow users to add or modify pictures or videos
could also be considered as ancillary feature as such filter cannot be used without the
principal service of the social network services consisting in the sharing of content online.

(8) The notion of remote biometric identification system as used in this Regulation should be
defined functionally, as an AI system intended for the identification of natural persons
without their active involvement, typically at a distance, through the comparison of a
person’s biometric data with the biometric data contained in a reference database,
irrespectively of the particular technology, processes or types of biometric data used. Such
remote biometric identification systems are typically used to perceive multiple persons or
their behaviour simultaneously in order to facilitate significantly the identification of
natural persons without their active involvement. This excludes AI systems intended to be
used for biometric verification, which includes authentication, whose sole purpose is to
confirm that a specific natural person is the person he or she claims to be and to confirm
the identity of a natural person for the sole purpose of having access to a service, unlocking
a device or having security access to premises. This exclusion is justified by the fact that
such systems are likely to have a minor impact on fundamental rights of natural persons
compared to the remote biometric identification systems which may be used for the
processing of the biometric data of a large number of persons without their active 
involvement. In the case of ‘real-time’ systems, the capturing of the biometric data, the
comparison and the identification occur all instantaneously, near-instantaneously or in any
event without a significant delay. In this regard, there should be no scope for
circumventing the rules of this Regulation on the ‘real-time’ use of the AI systems in
question by providing for minor delays. ‘Real-time’ systems involve the use of ‘live’ or
‘near-‘live’ material, such as video footage, generated by a camera or other device with
similar functionality. In the case of ‘post’ systems, in contrast, the biometric data have
already been captured and the comparison and identification occur only after a significant
delay. This involves material, such as pictures or video footage generated by closed circuit
television cameras or private devices, which has been generated before the use of the
system in respect of the natural persons concerned.

(8a) The notion of emotion recognition system for the purpose of in this regulation should be
defined as an AI system for the purpose of identifying or inferring emotions or intentions
of natural persons on the basis of their biometric data. This refers to emotions or intentions
such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust, embarrassment, excitement, shame,
contempt, satisfaction and amusement. It does not include physical states, such as pain or
fatigue. It refers for example to systems used in detecting the state of fatigue of
professional pilots or drivers for the purpose of preventing accidents. It does also not
include the mere detection of readily apparent expressions, gestures or movements, unless
they are used for identifying or inferring emotions. These expressions can be basic facial
expressions such as a frown or a smile, or gestures such as the movement of hands, arms or
head, or characteristics of a person’s voice, for example a raised voice or whispering.

(9) For the purposes of this Regulation the notion of publicly accessible space should be
understood as referring to any physical place that is accessible to an undetermined number
of natural persons, and irrespective of whether the place in question is privately or publicly
owned and irrespective of the activity for which the place may be used, such as commerce
(for instance, shops, restaurants, cafés), services (for instance, banks, professional
activities, hospitality), sport (for instance, swimming pools, gyms, stadiums), transport (for
instance, bus, metro and railway stations, airports, means of transport ), entertainment (for
instance, cinemas, theatres, museums, concert and conference halls) leisure or otherwise
(for instance, public roads and squares, parks, forests, playgrounds). A place should be
classified as publicly accessible also if, regardless of potential capacity or security
restrictions, access is subject to certain predetermined conditions, which can be fulfilled by
an undetermined number of persons, such as purchase of a ticket or title of transport, prior 
registration or having a certain age. By contrast, a place should not be considered publicly
accessible if access is limited to specific and defined natural persons through either Union
or national law directly related to public safety or security or through the clear
manifestation of will by the person having the relevant authority on the place. The factual
possibility of access alone (e.g. an unlocked door, an open gate in a fence) does not imply
that the place is publicly accessible in the presence of indications or circumstances
suggesting the contrary (e.g. signs prohibiting or restricting access). Company and factory
premises as well as offices and workplaces that are intended to be accessed only by
relevant employees and service providers are places that are not publicly accessible.
Publicly accessible spaces should not include prisons or border control. Some other areas
may be composed of both not publicly accessible and publicly accessible areas, such as the
hallway of a private residential building necessary to access a doctor's office or an airport.
Online spaces are not covered either, as they are not physical spaces. Whether a given
space is accessible to the public should however be determined on a case-by-case basis,
having regard to the specificities of the individual situation at hand.

(9b) In order to obtain the greatest benefits from AI systems while protecting fundamental
rights, health and safety and to enable democratic control, AI literacy should equip
providers, deployers and affected persons with the necessary notions to make informed
decisions regarding AI systems. These notions may vary with regard to the relevant context
and can include understanding the correct application of technical elements during the AI
system’s development phase, the measures to be applied during its use, the suitable ways in
which to interpret the AI system’s output, and, in the case of affected persons, the
knowledge necessary to understand how decisions taken with the assistance of AI will
impact them. In the context of the application this Regulation, AI literacy should provide
all relevant actors in the AI value chain with the insights required to ensure the appropriate
compliance and its correct enforcement. Furthermore, the wide implementation of AI
literacy measures and the introduction of appropriate follow-up actions could contribute to
improving working conditions and ultimately sustain the consolidation, and innovation
path of trustworthy AI in the Union. The European Artificial Intelligence Board should
support the Commission , to promote AI literacy tools, public awareness and understanding
of the benefits, risks, safeguards, rights and obligations in relation to the use of AI systems.
In cooperation with the relevant stakeholders, the Commission and the Member States
should facilitate the drawing up of voluntary codes of conduct to advance AI literacy
among persons dealing with the development, operation and use of AI .

(10) In order to ensure a level playing field and an effective protection of rights and freedoms of
individuals across the Union, the rules established by this Regulation should apply to
providers of AI systems in a non-discriminatory manner, irrespective of whether they are
established within the Union or in a third country, and to deployers of AI systems
established within the Union.

(11) In light of their digital nature, certain AI systems should fall within the scope of this
Regulation even when they are neither placed on the market, nor put into service, nor used
in the Union. This is the case for example of an operator established in the Union that
contracts certain services to an operator established outside the Union in relation to an
activity to be performed by an AI system that would qualify as high-risk. In those
circumstances, the AI system used by the operator outside the Union could process data
lawfully collected in and transferred from the Union, and provide to the contracting
operator in the Union the output of that AI system resulting from that processing, without
that AI system being placed on the market, put into service or used in the Union. To
prevent the circumvention of this Regulation and to ensure an effective protection of
natural persons located in the Union, this Regulation should also apply to providers and
deployers of AI systems that are established in a third country, to the extent the output
produced by those systems is intended to be used in the Union. Nonetheless, to take into
account existing arrangements and special needs for future cooperation with foreign
partners with whom information and evidence is exchanged, this Regulation should not
apply to public authorities of a third country and international organisations when acting in
the framework of cooperation or international agreements concluded at national or
European level for law enforcement and judicial cooperation with the Union or with its
Member States, under the condition that this third country or international organisations
provide adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of fundamental rights and
freedoms of individuals. Where relevant, this may also cover activities of entities entrusted
by the third countries to carry out specific tasks in support of such law enforcement and
judicial cooperation. Such framework for cooperation or agreements have been established
bilaterally between Member States and third countries or between the European Union,
Europol and other EU agencies and third countries and international organisations. The
authorities competent for supervision of the law enforcement and judicial authorities under
the AI Act should assess whether these frameworks for cooperation or international
agreements include adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of fundamental
rights and freedoms of individuals. Recipient Member States authorities and Union 
institutions, offices and bodies making use of such outputs in the Union remain
accountable to ensure their use complies with Union law. When those international
agreements are revised or new ones are concluded in the future, the contracting parties
should undertake the utmost effort to align those agreements with the requirements of this
Regulation.

(12) This Regulation should also apply to Union institutions, offices, bodies and agencies when
acting as a provider or deployer of an AI system.

(12a) If and insofar AI systems are placed on the market, put into service, or used with or
without modification of such systems for military, defence or national security purposes,
those should be excluded from the scope of this Regulation regardless of which type of
entity is carrying out those activities, such as whether it is a public or private entity. As
regards military and defence purposes, such exclusion is justified both by Article 4(2) TEU
and by the specifities of the Member States’ and the common Union defence policy
covered by Chapter 2 of Title V of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) that are subject to
public international law, which is therefore the more appropriate legal framework for the
regulation of AI systems in the context of the use of lethal force and other AI systems in
the context of military and defence activities. As regards national security purposes, the
exclusion is justified both by the fact that national security remains the sole responsibility
of Member States in accordance with Article 4(2) TEU and by the specific nature and
operational needs of national security activities and specific national rules applicable to
those activities. Nonetheless, if an AI system developed, placed on the market, put into
service or used for military, defence or national security purposes is used outside those
temporarily or permanently for other purposes (for example, civilian or humanitarian
purposes, law enforcement or public security purposes), such a system would fall within
the scope of this Regulation. In that case, the entity using the system for other than
military, defence or national security purposes should ensure compliance of the system
with this Regulation, unless the system is already compliant with this Regulation. AI
systems placed on the market or put into service for an excluded (i.e. military, defence or
national security) and one or more non excluded purposes (e.g. civilian purposes, law
enforcement, etc.), fall within the scope of this Regulation and providers of those systems
should ensure compliance with this Regulation. In those cases, the fact that an AI system
may fall within the scope of this Regulation should not affect the possibility of entities
carrying out national security, defence and military activities, regardless of the type of
entity carrying out those activities, to use AI systems for national security, military and 
defence purposes, the use of which is excluded from the scope of this Regulation. An AI
system placed on the market for civilian or law enforcement purposes which is used with
or without modification for military, defence or national security purposes should not fall
within the scope of this Regulation, regardless of the type of entity carrying out those
activities.

(12c) This Regulation should support innovation, respect freedom of science, and should not
undermine research and development activity. It is therefore necessary to exclude from its
scope AI systems and models specifically developed and put into service for the sole
purpose of scientific research and development. Moreover, it is necessary to ensure that the
Regulation does not otherwise affect scientific research and development activity on AI
systems or models prior to being placed on the market or put into service. As regards
product oriented research, testing and development activity regarding AI systems or
models, the provisions of this Regulation should also not apply prior to these systems and
models being put into service or placed on the market. This is without prejudice to the
obligation to comply with this Regulation when an AI system falling into the scope of this
Regulation is placed on the market or put into service as a result of such research and
development activity and to the application of provisions on regulatory sandboxes and
testing in real world conditions. Furthermore, without prejudice to the foregoing regarding
AI systems specifically developed and put into service for the sole purpose of scientific
research and development, any other AI system that may be used for the conduct of any
research and development activity should remain subject to the provisions of this
Regulation. Under all circumstances, any research and development activity should be
carried out in accordance with recognised ethical and professional standards for scientific
research and should be conducted according to applicable Union law.

(14) In order to introduce a proportionate and effective set of binding rules for AI systems, a
clearly defined risk-based approach should be followed. That approach should tailor the
type and content of such rules to the intensity and scope of the risks that AI systems can
generate. It is therefore necessary to prohibit certain unacceptable artificial intelligence
practices, to lay down requirements for high-risk AI systems and obligations for the
relevant operators, and to lay down transparency obligations for certain AI systems.

(14a) While the risk-based approach is the basis for a proportionate and effective set of binding
rules, it is important to recall the 2019 Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI developed by 
the independent High-Level Expert Group on AI (HLEG) appointed by the Commission.
In those Guidelines the HLEG developed seven non-binding ethical principles for AI
which should help ensure that AI is trustworthy and ethically sound. The seven principles
include: human agency and oversight; technical robustness and safety; privacy and data
governance; transparency; diversity, non-discrimination and fairness; societal and
environmental well-being and accountability. Without prejudice to the legally binding
requirements of this Regulation and any other applicable Union law, these Guidelines
contribute to the design of a coherent, trustworthy and human-centric Artificial
Intelligence, in line with the Charter and with the values on which the Union is founded.
According to the Guidelines of HLEG, human agency and oversight means that AI
systems are developed and used as a tool that serves people, respects human dignity and
personal autonomy, and that is functioning in a way that can be appropriately controlled
and overseen by humans. Technical robustness and safety means that AI systems are
developed and used in a way that allows robustness in case of problems and resilience
against attempts to alter the use or performance of the AI system so as to allow unlawful
use by third parties, and minimise unintended harm . Privacy and data governance means
that AI systems are developed and used in compliance with existing privacy and data
protection rules, while processing data that meets high standards in terms of quality and
integrity. Transparency means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that
allows appropriate traceability and explainability, while making humans aware that they
communicate or interact with an AI system, as well as duly informing deployers of the
capabilities and limitations of that AI system and affected persons about their rights.
Diversity, non-discrimination and fairness means that AI systems are developed and used
in a way that includes diverse actors and promotes equal access, gender equality and
cultural diversity, while avoiding discriminatory impacts and unfair biases that are
prohibited by Union or national law. Social and environmental well-being means that AI
systems are developed and used in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner as
well as in a way to benefit all human beings, while monitoring and assessing the long-term
impacts on the individual, society and democracy. The application of these principles
should be translated, when possible, in the design and use of AI models. They should in
any case serve as a basis for the drafting of codes of conduct under this Regulation. All
stakeholders, including industry, academia, civil society and standardisation organisations,
are encouraged to take into account as appropriate the ethical principles for the
development of voluntary best practices and standards. 

(15) Aside from the many beneficial uses of artificial intelligence, that technology can also be
misused and provide novel and powerful tools for manipulative, exploitative and social
control practices. Such practices are particularly harmful and abusive and should be
prohibited because they contradict Union values of respect for human dignity, freedom,
equality, democracy and the rule of law and Union fundamental rights, including the right
to non-discrimination, data protection and privacy and the rights of the child.

(16) AI-enabled manipulative techniques can be used to persuade persons to engage in
unwanted behaviours, or to deceive them by nudging them into decisions in a way that
subverts and impairs their autonomy, decision-making and free choices. The placing on the
market, putting into service or use of certain AI systems with the objective to or the effect
of materially distorting human behaviour, whereby significant harms, in particular having
sufficiently important adverse impacts on physical, psychological health or financial
interests are likely to occur, are particularly dangerous and should therefore be forbidden.
Such AI systems deploy subliminal components such as audio, image, video stimuli that
persons cannot perceive as those stimuli are beyond human perception or other
manipulative or deceptive techniques that subvert or impair person’s autonomy, decisionmaking or free choices in ways that people are not consciously aware of, or even if aware
they are still deceived or not able to control or resist. This could be for example, facilitated
by machine-brain interfaces or virtual reality as they allow for a higher degree of control of
what stimuli are presented to persons, insofar as they may be materially distorting their
behaviour in a significantly harmful manner. In addition, AI systems may also otherwise
exploit vulnerabilities of a person or a specific group of persons due to their age, disability
within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2019/882, or a specific social or economic situation
that is likely to make those persons more vulnerable to exploitation such as persons living
in extreme poverty, ethnic or religious minorities. Such AI systems can be placed on the
market, put into service or used with the objective to or the effect of materially distorting
the behaviour of a person and in a manner that causes or is reasonably likely to cause
significant harm to that or another person or groups of persons, including harms that may
be accumulated over time and should therefore be prohibited. The intention to distort the
behaviour may not be presumed if the distortion results from factors external to the AI
system which are outside of the control of the provider or the deployer, meaning factors
that may not be reasonably foreseen and mitigated by the provider or the deployer of the
AI system. In any case, it is not necessary for the provider or the deployer to have the
intention to cause significant harm, as long as such harm results from the manipulative or 
exploitative AI-enabled practices. The prohibitions for such AI practices are
complementary to the provisions contained in Directive 2005/29/EC, notably unfair
commercial practices leading to economic or financial harms to consumers are prohibited
under all circumstances, irrespective of whether they are put in place through AI systems
or otherwise. The prohibitions of manipulative and exploitative practices in this
Regulation should not affect lawful practices in the context of medical treatment such as
psychological treatment of a mental disease or physical rehabilitation, when those practices
are carried out in accordance with the applicable legislation and medical standards, for
example explicit consent of the individuals or their legal representatives . In addition,
common and legitimate commercial practices, for example in the field of advertising, that
are in compliance with the applicable law should not in themselves be regarded as
constituting harmful manipulative AI practices.

(16a) Biometric categorisation systems that are based on individuals’ biometric data, such as an
individual person’s face or fingerprint, to deduce or infer an individuals’ political opinions,
trade union membership, religious or philosophical beliefs, race, sex life or sexual
orientation should be prohibited. This prohibition does not cover the lawful labelling,
filtering or categorisation of biometric datasets acquired in line with Union or national law
according to biometric data, such as the sorting of images according to hair colour or eye
colour, which can for example be used in the area of law enforcement.

(17) AI systems providing social scoring of natural persons by public or private actors may
lead to discriminatory outcomes and the exclusion of certain groups. They may violate the
right to dignity and non-discrimination and the values of equality and justice. Such AI
systems evaluate or classify natural persons or groups thereof based on multiple data points
related to their social behaviour in multiple contexts or known, inferred or predicted
personal or personality characteristics over certain periods of time. The social score
obtained from such AI systems may lead to the detrimental or unfavourable treatment of
natural persons or whole groups thereof in social contexts, which are unrelated to the
context in which the data was originally generated or collected or to a detrimental
treatment that is disproportionate or unjustified to the gravity of their social behaviour. AI
systems entailing such unacceptable scoring practices leading to such detrimental or
unfavorable outcomes should be therefore prohibited. This prohibition should not affect
lawful evaluation practices of natural persons done for a specific purpose in compliance
with national and Union law.

(18) The use of AI systems for ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification of natural persons in
publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement is particularly intrusive to
the rights and freedoms of the concerned persons, to the extent that it may affect the
private life of a large part of the population, evoke a feeling of constant surveillance and
indirectly dissuade the exercise of the freedom of assembly and other fundamental rights .
Technical inaccuracies of AI systems intended for the remote biometric identification of
natural persons can lead to biased results and entail discriminatory effects. This is
particularly relevant when it comes to age, ethnicity, race, sex or disabilities. In addition,
the immediacy of the impact and the limited opportunities for further checks or corrections
in relation to the use of such systems operating in ‘real-time’ carry heightened risks for the
rights and freedoms of the persons that are concerned by law enforcement activities.

(19) The use of those systems for the purpose of law enforcement should therefore be
prohibited, except in exhaustively listed and narrowly defined situations, where the use is
strictly necessary to achieve a substantial public interest, the importance of which
outweighs the risks. Those situations involve the search for certain victims of crime
including missing people; certain threats to the life or physical safety of natural persons or
of a terrorist attack; and the localisation or identification of perpetrators or suspects of the
criminal offences referred to in Annex IIa if those criminal offences are punishable in the
Member State concerned by a custodial sentence or a detention order for a maximum
period of at least four years and as they are defined in the law of that Member State. Such
threshold for the custodial sentence or detention order in accordance with national law
contributes to ensure that the offence should be serious enough to potentially justify the use
of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems. Moreover, the list of criminal
offences as referred in Annex IIa is based on the 32 criminal offences listed in the Council
Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA{FtNt.9.Xref}
, taking into account that some are in practice likely
to be more relevant than others, in that the recourse to ‘real-time’ remote biometric
identification will foreseeably be necessary and proportionate to highly varying degrees for
the practical pursuit of the localisation or identification of a perpetrator or suspect of the
different criminal offences listed and having regard to the likely differences in the
seriousness, probability and scale of the harm or possible negative consequences.
An imminent threat to life or physical safety of natural persons could also result from a
serious disruption of critical infrastructure, as defined in Article 2, point (a) of Directive
9 Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA of 13 June 2002 on the European arrest
warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States (OJ L 190, 18.7.2002, p. 1).
2008/114/EC, where the disruption or destruction of such critical infrastructure would
result in an imminent threat to life or physical safety of a person, including through serious
harm to the provision of basic supplies to the population or to the exercise of the core
function of the State.

In addition, this Regulation should preserve the ability for law enforcement, border control,
immigration or asylum authorities to carry out identity checks in the presence of the person
that is concerned in accordance with the conditions set out in Union and national law for
such checks. In particular, law enforcement, border control, immigration or asylum
authorities should be able to use information systems, in accordance with Union or national
law, to identify a person who, during an identity check, either refuses to be identified or is
unable to state or prove his or her identity, without being required by this Regulation to
obtain prior authorisation. This could be, for example, a person involved in a crime, being
unwilling, or unable due to an accident or a medical condition, to disclose their identity to
law enforcement authorities.

(20) In order to ensure that those systems are used in a responsible and proportionate manner, it
is also important to establish that, in each of those exhaustively listed and narrowly
defined situations, certain elements should be taken into account, in particular as regards
the nature of the situation giving rise to the request and the consequences of the use for the
rights and freedoms of all persons concerned and the safeguards and conditions provided
for with the use. In addition, the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems
in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement should only be deployed
to confirm the specifically target individual’s identity and should be limited to what is
strictly necessary concerning the period of time as well as geographic and personal scope,
having regard in particular to the evidence or indications regarding the threats, the victims
or perpetrator. The use of the ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification system in publicly
accessible spaces should only be authorised if the law enforcement authority has completed
a fundamental rights impact assessment and, unless provided otherwise in this Regulation,
has registered the system in the database as set out in this Regulation. The reference
database of persons should be appropriate for each use case in each of the situations
mentioned above.

(21) Each use of a ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification system in publicly accessible
spaces for the purpose of law enforcement should be subject to an express and specific
authorisation by a judicial authority or by an independent administrative authority whose
decision is binding of a Member State. Such authorisation should in principle be obtained 
prior to the use of the system with a view to identify a person or persons. Exceptions to this
rule should be allowed in duly justified situations of urgency, that is, situations where the
need to use the systems in question is such as to make it effectively and objectively
impossible to obtain an authorisation before commencing the use. In such situations of
urgency, the use should be restricted to the absolute minimum necessary and be subject to
appropriate safeguards and conditions, as determined in national law and specified in the
context of each individual urgent use case by the law enforcement authority itself. In
addition, the law enforcement authority should in such situations request such
authorisation whilst providing the reasons for not having been able to request it earlier,
without undue delay and, at the latest within 24 hours. If such authorisation is rejected, the
use of real-time biometric identification systems linked to that authorisation should be
stopped with immediate effect and all the data related to such use should be discarded and
deleted. Such data includes input data directly acquired by an AI system in the course of
the use of such system as well as the results and outputs of the use linked to that
authorisation. It should not include input legally acquired in accordance with another
national or Union law. In any case, no decision producing an adverse legal effect on a
person may be taken solely based on the output of the remote biometric identification
system.

(21a) In order to carry out their tasks in accordance with the requirements set out in this
Regulation as well as in national rules, the relevant market surveillance authority and the
national data protection authority should be notified of each use of the ‘real-time biometric
identification system’. National market surveillance authorities and the national data
protection authorities that have been notified should submit to the Commission an annual
report on the use of ‘real-time biometric identification systems’.

(22) Furthermore, it is appropriate to provide, within the exhaustive framework set by this
Regulation that such use in the territory of a Member State in accordance with this
Regulation should only be possible where and in as far as the Member State in question has
decided to expressly provide for the possibility to authorise such use in its detailed rules of
national law. Consequently, Member States remain free under this Regulation not to
provide for such a possibility at all or to only provide for such a possibility in respect of
some of the objectives capable of justifying authorised use identified in this Regulation.
These national rules should be notified to the Commission at the latest 30 days following
their adoption. 

(23) The use of AI systems for ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification of natural persons in
publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement necessarily involves the
processing of biometric data. The rules of this Regulation that prohibit, subject to certain
exceptions, such use, which are based on Article 16 TFEU, should apply as lex specialis in
respect of the rules on the processing of biometric data contained in Article 10 of Directive
(EU) 2016/680, thus regulating such use and the processing of biometric data involved in
an exhaustive manner. Therefore, such use and processing should only be possible in as far
as it is compatible with the framework set by this Regulation, without there being scope,
outside that framework, for the competent authorities, where they act for purpose of law
enforcement, to use such systems and process such data in connection thereto on the
grounds listed in Article 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680. In this context, this Regulation is
not intended to provide the legal basis for the processing of personal data under Article 8
of Directive 2016/680. However, the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification
systems in publicly accessible spaces for purposes other than law enforcement, including
by competent authorities, should not be covered by the specific framework regarding such
use for the purpose of law enforcement set by this Regulation. Such use for purposes other
than law enforcement should therefore not be subject to the requirement of an authorisation
under this Regulation and the applicable detailed rules of national law that may give effect
to it.

(24) Any processing of biometric data and other personal data involved in the use of AI systems
for biometric identification, other than in connection to the use of ‘real-time’ remote
biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law
enforcement as regulated by this Regulation, should continue to comply with all
requirements resulting from Article 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680. For purposes other
than law enforcement, Article 9(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Article 10(1) of
Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 prohibit the processing of biometric data subject to limited
exceptions as provided in those articles. In application of Article 9(1) of Regulation (EU)
2016/679, the use of remote biometric identification for purposes other than law
enforcement has already been subject to prohibition decisions by national data protection
authorities.

(25) In accordance with Article 6a of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom
and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, as annexed to the TEU
and to the TFEU, Ireland is not bound by the rules laid down in Article 5(1), point (d), (2),
(3), (3a), (4) and (5), Article 5(1)(ba) to the extent it applies to the use of biometric 
categorisation systems for activities in the field of police cooperation and judicial
cooperation in criminal matters, Article 5(1)(da) to the extent it applies to the use of AI
systems covered by that provision and Article 29(6a) of this Regulation adopted on the
basis of Article 16 of the TFEU which relate to the processing of personal data by the
Member States when carrying out activities falling within the scope of Chapter 4 or
Chapter 5 of Title V of Part Three of the TFEU, where Ireland is not bound by the rules
governing the forms of judicial cooperation in criminal matters or police cooperation
which require compliance with the provisions laid down on the basis of Article 16 of the
TFEU.

(26) In accordance with Articles 2 and 2a of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark,
annexed to the TEU and TFEU, Denmark is not bound by rules laid down in Article 5(1),
point (d), (2), (3), (3a), (4) and (5), Article 5(1)(ba) to the extent it applies to the use of
biometric categorisation systems for activities in the field of police cooperation and
judicial cooperation in criminal matters, Article 5(1)(da) to the extent it applies to the use
of AI systems covered by that provision and Article 29(6a) of this Regulation adopted on
the basis of Article 16 of the TFEU, or subject to their application, which relate to the
processing of personal data by the Member States when carrying out activities falling
within the scope of Chapter 4 or Chapter 5 of Title V of Part Three of the TFEU.
(26a) In line with the presumption of innocence, natural persons in the EU should always be
judged on their actual behaviour. Natural persons should never be judged on AI-predicted
behaviour based solely on their profiling, personality traits or characteristics, such as
nationality, place of birth, place of residence, number of children, debt, their type of car,
without a reasonable suspicion of that person being involved in a criminal activity based on
objective verifiable facts and without human assessment thereof. Therefore, risk
assessments of natural persons in order to assess the risk of them offending or for
predicting the occurrence of an actual or potential criminal offence solely based on the
profiling of a natural person or on assessing their personality traits and characteristics
should be prohibited. In any case, this prohibition does not refer to nor touch upon risk
analytics that are not based on the profiling of individuals or on the personality traits and
characteristics of individuals, such as AI systems using risk analytics to assess the risk of
financial fraud by undertakings based on suspicious transactions or risk analytic tools to
predict the likelihood of localisation of narcotics or illicit goods by customs authorities, for
example based on known trafficking routes.

(26b) The placing on the market, putting into service for this specific purpose, or use of AI
systems that create or expand facial recognition databases through the untargeted scraping
of facial images from the internet or CCTV footage should be prohibited, as this practice
adds to the feeling of mass surveillance and can lead to gross violations of fundamental
rights, including the right to privacy.

(26c) There are serious concerns about the scientific basis of AI systems aiming to identify or
infer emotions, particularly as expression of emotions vary considerably across cultures
and situations, and even within a single individual. Among the key shortcomings of such
systems are the limited reliability, the lack of specificity and the limited generalizability.
Therefore, AI systems identifying or inferring emotions or intentions of natural persons on
the basis of their biometric data may lead to discriminatory outcomes and can be intrusive
to the rights and freedoms of the concerned persons. Considering the imbalance of power
in the context of work or education, combined with the intrusive nature of these systems,
such systems could lead to detrimental or unfavourable treatment of certain natural persons
or whole groups thereof. Therefore, the placing on the market, putting into service, or use
of AI systems intended to be used to detect the emotional state of individuals in situations
related to the workplace and education should be prohibited. This prohibition should not
cover AI systems placed on the market strictly for medical or safety reasons, such as
systems intended for therapeutical use.

(26d) Practices that are prohibited by Union legislation, including data protection law, nondiscrimination law, consumer protection law, and competition law, should not be affected
by this Regulation.

(27) High-risk AI systems should only be placed on the Union market, put into service or used
if they comply with certain mandatory requirements. Those requirements should ensure
that high-risk AI systems available in the Union or whose output is otherwise used in the
Union do not pose unacceptable risks to important Union public interests as recognised and
protected by Union law. Following the New Legislative Framework approach, as clarified
in Commission notice the ‘Blue Guide’ on the implementation of EU product rules 2022
(C/2022/3637) the general rule is that several pieces of the EU legislation, such as
Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on Medical Devices and Regulation (EU) 2017/746 on In Vitro
Diagnostic Devices or Directive 2006/42/EC on Machinery, may have to be taken into
consideration for one product, since the making available or putting into service can only
take place when the product complies with all applicable Union harmonisation legislation. 
To ensure consistency and avoid unnecessary administrative burden or costs, providers of a
product that contains one or more high-risk artificial intelligence system, to which the
requirements of this Regulation as well as requirements of the Union harmonisation
legislation listed in Annex II, Section A apply, should have a flexibility on operational
decisions on how to ensure compliance of a product that contains one or more artificial
intelligence systems with all applicable requirements of the Union harmonised legislation
in a best way. AI systems identified as high-risk should be limited to those that have a
significant harmful impact on the health, safety and fundamental rights of persons in the
Union and such limitation minimises any potential restriction to international trade, if any.
(28) AI systems could have an adverse impact to health and safety of persons, in particular
when such systems operate as safety components of products. Consistently with the
objectives of Union harmonisation legislation to facilitate the free movement of products in
the internal market and to ensure that only safe and otherwise compliant products find their
way into the market, it is important that the safety risks that may be generated by a product
as a whole due to its digital components, including AI systems, are duly prevented and
mitigated. For instance, increasingly autonomous robots, whether in the context of
manufacturing or personal assistance and care should be able to safely operate and
performs their functions in complex environments. Similarly, in the health sector where the
stakes for life and health are particularly high, increasingly sophisticated diagnostics
systems and systems supporting human decisions should be reliable and accurate.

(28a) The extent of the adverse impact caused by the AI system on the fundamental rights
protected by the Charter is of particular relevance when classifying an AI system as highrisk. Those rights include the right to human dignity, respect for private and family life,
protection of personal data, freedom of expression and information, freedom of assembly
and of association, and non-discrimination, right to education consumer protection,
workers’ rights, rights of persons with disabilities, gender equality, intellectual property
rights, right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, right of defence and the presumption
of innocence, right to good administration. In addition to those rights, it is important to
highlight that children have specific rights as enshrined in Article 24 of the EU Charter and
in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (further elaborated in the
UNCRC General Comment No. 25 as regards the digital environment), both of which
require consideration of the children’s vulnerabilities and provision of such protection and
care as necessary for their well-being. The fundamental right to a high level of
environmental protection enshrined in the Charter and implemented in Union policies 
should also be considered when assessing the severity of the harm that an AI system can
cause, including in relation to the health and safety of persons.

(29) As regards high-risk AI systems that are safety components of products or systems, or
which are themselves products or systems falling within the scope of Regulation (EC) No
300/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council10, Regulation (EU) No 167/2013
of the European Parliament and of the Council11, Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 of the
European Parliament and of the Council12, Directive 2014/90/EU of the European
Parliament and of the Council13, Directive (EU) 2016/797 of the European Parliament and
of the Council14, Regulation (EU) 2018/858 of the European Parliament and of the
Council15, Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 of the European Parliament and of the Council{FtNt.16.Xref}
,
and Regulation (EU) 2019/2144 of the European Parliament and of the Council{FtNt.17.Xref}, it is
appropriate to amend those acts to ensure that the Commission takes into account, on the
basis of the technical and regulatory specificities of each sector, and without interfering
with existing governance, conformity assessment and enforcement mechanisms and
authorities established therein, the mandatory requirements for high-risk AI systems laid
down in this Regulation when adopting any relevant future delegated or implementing acts
on the basis of those acts.

(30) As regards AI systems that are safety components of products, or which are themselves
products, falling within the scope of certain Union harmonisation legislation listed in
Annex II, it is appropriate to classify them as high-risk under this Regulation if the product
in question undergoes the conformity assessment procedure with a third-party conformity
assessment body pursuant to that relevant Union harmonisation legislation. In particular,
such products are machinery, toys, lifts, equipment and protective systems intended for use
in potentially explosive atmospheres, radio equipment, pressure equipment, recreational
craft equipment, cableway installations, appliances burning gaseous fuels, medical devices,
and in vitro diagnostic medical devices.

(31) The classification of an AI system as high-risk pursuant to this Regulation should not
necessarily mean that the product whose safety component is the AI system, or the AI
system itself as a product, is considered ‘high-risk’ under the criteria established in the
relevant Union harmonisation legislation that applies to the product. This is notably the
case for Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the Council18 and
Regulation (EU) 2017/746 of the European Parliament and of the Council19, where a thirdparty conformity assessment is provided for medium-risk and high-risk products.

(32) As regards stand-alone AI systems, meaning high-risk AI systems other than those that are
safety components of products, or which are themselves products, it is appropriate to
classify them as high-risk if, in the light of their intended purpose, they pose a high risk of
harm to the health and safety or the fundamental rights of persons, taking into account both
the severity of the possible harm and its probability of occurrence and they are used in a
number of specifically pre-defined areas specified in the Regulation. The identification of
those systems is based on the same methodology and criteria envisaged also for any future
amendments of the list of high-risk AI systems that the Commission should be empowered
to adopt, via delegated acts, to take into account the rapid pace of technological
development, as well as the potential changes in the use of AI systems.

(32a) It is also important to clarify that there may be specific cases in which AI systems referred
to pre-defined areas specified in this Regulation do not lead to a significant risk of harm to
the legal interests protected under those areas, because they do not materially influence the
decision-making or do not harm those interests substantially. For the purpose of this
Regulation an AI system not materially influencing the outcome of decision-making
should be understood as an AI system that does not impact the substance, and thereby the
outcome, of decision-making, whether human or automated. This could be the case if one
or more of the following conditions are fulfilled. The first criterion should be that the AI
system is intended to perform a narrow procedural task, such as an AI system that
transforms unstructured data into structured data, an AI system that classifies incoming
documents into categories or an AI system that is used to detect duplicates among a large
number of applications. These tasks are of such narrow and limited nature that they pose
only limited risks which are not increased through the use in a context listed in Annex III.
The second criterion should be that the task performed by the AI system is intended to
improve the result of a previously completed human activity that may be relevant for the
purpose of the use case listed in Annex III. Considering these characteristics, the AI system
only provides an additional layer to a human activity with consequently lowered risk. For
example, this criterion would apply to AI systems that are intended to improve the
language used in previously drafted documents, for instance in relation to professional
tone, academic style of language or by aligning text to a certain brand messaging. The third
criterion should be that the AI system is intended to detect decision-making patterns or
deviations from prior decision-making patterns. The risk would be lowered because the use
of the AI system follows a previously completed human assessment which it is not meant
to replace or influence, without proper human review. Such AI systems include for
instance those that, given a certain grading pattern of a teacher, can be used to check ex
post whether the teacher may have deviated from the grading pattern so as to flag potential
inconsistencies or anomalies. The fourth criterion should be that the AI system is intended 
to perform a task that is only preparatory to an assessment relevant for the purpose of the
use case listed in Annex III, thus making the possible impact of the output of the system
very low in terms of representing a risk for the assessment to follow. For example, this
criterion covers smart solutions for file handling, which include various functions from
indexing, searching, text and speech processing or linking data to other data sources, or AI
systems used for translation of initial documents. In any case, AI systems referred to in
Annex III should be considered to pose signficant risks of harm to the health, safety or
fundamental rights of natural persons if the AI system implies profiling within the meaning
of Article 4(4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Article 3(4) of Directive (EU) 2016/680
and Article 3(5) of Regulation 2018/1725. To ensure traceability and transparency, a
provider who considers that an AI system referred to in Annex III is not high-risk on the
basis of the aforementioned criteria should draw up documentation of the assessment
before that system is placed on the market or put into service and should provide this
documentation to national competent authorities upon request. Such provider should be
obliged to register the system in the EU database established under this Regulation. With a
view to provide further guidance for the practical implementation of the criteria under
which AI systems referred to in Annex III are exceptionally not high-risk, the Commission
should, after consulting the AI Board, provide guidelines specifying this practical
implementation completed by a comprehensive list of practical examples of high risk and
non-high risk use cases of AI systems.

(33)

(33a) As biometric data constitutes a special category of sensitive personal data, it is appropriate
to classify as high-risk several critical use-cases of biometric systems, insofar as their use
is permitted under relevant Union and national law. Technical inaccuracies of AI systems
intended for the remote biometric identification of natural persons can lead to biased
results and entail discriminatory effects. This is particularly relevant when it comes to age,
ethnicity, race, sex or disabilities. Therefore, remote biometric identification systems
should be classified as high-risk in view of the risks that they pose. This excludes AI
systems intended to be used for biometric verification, which includes authentication,
whose sole purpose is to confirm that a specific natural person is the person he or she
claims to be and to confirm the identity of a natural person for the sole purpose of having
access to a service, unlocking a device or having secure access to premises.
In addition, AI systems intended to be used for biometric categorisation according to
sensitive attributes or characteristics protected under Article 9(1) of Regulation (EU) 
2016/679 based on biometric data, in so far as these are not prohibited under this
Regulation, and emotion recognition systems that are not prohibited under this Regulation,
should be classified as high-risk. Biometric systems which are intended to be used solely
for the purpose of enabling cybersecurity and personal data protection measures should not
be considered as high risk systems.

(34) As regards the management and operation of critical infrastructure, it is appropriate to
classify as high-risk the AI systems intended to be used as safety components in the
management and operation of critical digital infrastructure as listed in Annex I point 8 of
the Directive on the resilience of critical entities, road traffic and the supply of water, gas,
heating and electricity, since their failure or malfunctioning may put at risk the life and
health of persons at large scale and lead to appreciable disruptions in the ordinary conduct
of social and economic activities. Safety components of critical infrastructure, including
critical digital infrastrucure, are systems used to directly protect the physical integrity of
critical infrastructure or health and safety of persons and property but which are not
necessary in order for the system to function. Failure or malfunctioning of such
components might directly lead to risks to the physical integrity of critical infrastructure
and thus to risks to health and safety of persons and property. Components intended to be
used solely for cybersecurity purposes should not qualify as safety components. Examples
of safety components of such critical infrastructure may include systems for monitoring
water pressure or fire alarm controlling systems in cloud computing centres.

(35) Deployment of AI systems in education is important to promote high-quality digital
education and training and to allow all learners and teachers to acquire and share the
necessary digital skills and competences, including media literacy, and critical thinking, to
take an active part in the economy, society, and in democratic processes. However, AI
systems used in education or vocational training, notably for determining access or
admission, for assigning persons to educational and vocational training institutions or
programmes at all levels, for evaluating learning outcomes of persons, for assessing the
appropriate level of education for an individual and materially influencing the level of
education and training that individuals will receive or be able to access or for monitoring
and detecting prohibited behaviour of students during tests should be classified as high-risk
AI systems, since they may determine the educational and professional course of a
person’s life and therefore affect their ability to secure their livelihood. When improperly
designed and used, such systems can be particularly intrusive and may violate the right to
education and training as well as the right not to be discriminated against and perpetuate 
historical patterns of discrimination, for example against women, certain age groups,
persons with disabilities, or persons of certain racial or ethnic origins or sexual orientation.

(36) AI systems used in employment, workers management and access to self-employment,
notably for the recruitment and selection of persons, for making decisions affecting terms
of the work related relationship promotion and termination of work-related contractual
relationships for allocating tasks based on individual behaviour, personal traits or
characteristics and for monitoring or evaluation of persons in work-related contractual
relationships, should also be classified as high-risk, since those systems may appreciably
impact future career prospects, livelihoods of these persons and workers’ rights. Relevant
work-related contractual relationships should meaningfully involve employees and persons
providing services through platforms as referred to in the Commission Work Programme
2021. Throughout the recruitment process and in the evaluation, promotion, or retention of
persons in work-related contractual relationships, such systems may perpetuate historical
patterns of discrimination, for example against women, certain age groups, persons with
disabilities, or persons of certain racial or ethnic origins or sexual orientation. AI systems
used to monitor the performance and behaviour of these persons may also undermine their
fundamental rights to data protection and privacy.

(37) Another area in which the use of AI systems deserves special consideration is the access to
and enjoyment of certain essential private and public services and benefits necessary for
people to fully participate in society or to improve one’s standard of living. In particular,
natural persons applying for or receiving essential public assistance benefits and services
from public authorities namely healthcare services, social security benefits, social services
providing protection in cases such as maternity, illness, industrial accidents, dependency or
old age and loss of employment and social and housing assistance, are typically dependent
on those benefits and services and in a vulnerable position in relation to the responsible
authorities. If AI systems are used for determining whether such benefits and services
should be granted, denied, reduced, revoked or reclaimed by authorities, including whether
beneficiaries are legitimately entitled to such benefits or services, those systems may have
a significant impact on persons’ livelihood and may infringe their fundamental rights, such
as the right to social protection, non-discrimination, human dignity or an effective remedy
and should therefore be classified as high-risk. Nonetheless, this Regulation should not
hamper the development and use of innovative approaches in the public administration,
which would stand to benefit from a wider use of compliant and safe AI systems, provided
that those systems do not entail a high risk to legal and natural persons. In addition, AI 
systems used to evaluate the credit score or creditworthiness of natural persons should be
classified as high-risk AI systems, since they determine those persons’ access to financial
resources or essential services such as housing, electricity, and telecommunication
services. AI systems used for this purpose may lead to discrimination of persons or groups
and perpetuate historical patterns of discrimination, for example based on racial or ethnic
origins, gender, disabilities, age, sexual orientation, or create new forms of discriminatory
impacts. However, AI systems provided for by Union law for the purpose of detecting
fraud in the offering of financial services and for prudential purposes to calculate credit
institutions’ and insurances undertakings’ capital requirements should not be considered as
high-risk under this Regulation. Moreover, AI systems intended to be used for risk
assessment and pricing in relation to natural persons for health and life insurance can also
have a significant impact on persons’ livelihood and if not duly designed, developed and
used, can infringe their fundamental rights and can lead to serious consequences for
people’s life and health, including financial exclusion and discrimination. Finally, AI
systems used to evaluate and classify emergency calls by natural persons or to dispatch or
establish priority in the dispatching of emergency first response services, including by
police, firefighters and medical aid, as well as of emergency healthcare patient triage
systems, should also be classified as high-risk since they make decisions in very critical
situations for the life and health of persons and their property.

(38) Given their role and responsibility, actions by law enforcement authorities involving
certain uses of AI systems are characterised by a significant degree of power imbalance
and may lead to surveillance, arrest or deprivation of a natural person’s liberty as well as
other adverse impacts on fundamental rights guaranteed in the Charter. In particular, if the
AI system is not trained with high quality data, does not meet adequate requirements in
terms of its performance, its accuracy or robustness, or is not properly designed and tested
before being put on the market or otherwise put into service, it may single out people in a
discriminatory or otherwise incorrect or unjust manner. Furthermore, the exercise of
important procedural fundamental rights, such as the right to an effective remedy and to a
fair trial as well as the right of defence and the presumption of innocence, could be
hampered, in particular, where such AI systems are not sufficiently transparent,
explainable and documented. It is therefore appropriate to classify as high-risk, insofar as
their use is permitted under relevant Union and national law, a number of AI systems
intended to be used in the law enforcement context where accuracy, reliability and
transparency is particularly important to avoid adverse impacts, retain public trust and 
ensure accountability and effective redress. In view of the nature of the activities in
question and the risks relating thereto, those high-risk AI systems should include in
particular AI systems intended to be used by or on behalf of law enforcement authorities or
by Union agencies, offices or bodies in support of law enforcement authorities for
assessing the risk of a natural person to become a victim of criminal offences, as
polygraphs and similar tools , for the evaluation of the reliability of evidence in in the
course of investigation or prosecution of criminal offences, and, insofar not prohibited
under this regulation, for assessing the risk of a natural person of offending or reoffending
not solely based on profiling of natural persons nor based on assessing personality traits
and characteristics or past criminal behaviour of natural persons or groups, for profiling in
the course of detection, investigation or prosecution of criminal offences, . AI systems
specifically intended to be used for administrative proceedings by tax and customs
authorities as well as by financial intelligence units carrying out adminstrative tasks
analysing information pursuant to Union anti-money laundering legislation should not be
classified as high-risk AI systems used by law enforcement authorities for the purposes of
prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences. The use of AI
tools by law enforcement and authorities should not become a factor of inequality, or
exclusion. The impact of the use of AI tools on the defence rights of suspects should not be
ignored, notably the difficulty in obtaining meaningful information on the functioning of
these systems and the consequent difficulty in challenging their results in court, in
particular by individuals under investigation.

(39) AI systems used in migration, asylum and border control management affect people who
are often in particularly vulnerable position and who are dependent on the outcome of the
actions of the competent public authorities. The accuracy, non-discriminatory nature and
transparency of the AI systems used in those contexts are therefore particularly important
to guarantee the respect of the fundamental rights of the affected persons, notably their
rights to free movement, non-discrimination, protection of private life and personal data,
international protection and good administration. It is therefore appropriate to classify as
high-risk, insofar as their use is permitted under relevant Union and national law AI
systems intended to be used by or on behalf of competent public authorities or by Union
agencies, offices or bodies charged with tasks in the fields of migration, asylum and border
control management as polygraphs and similar tools, for assessing certain risks posed by
natural persons entering the territory of a Member State or applying for visa or asylum, for
assisting competent public authorities for the examination, including related assessment of 
the reliability of evidence, of applications for asylum, visa and residence permits and
associated complaints with regard to the objective to establish the eligibility of the natural
persons applying for a status, for the purpose of detecting, recognising or identifying
natural persons in the context of migration, asylum and border control management with
the exception of travel documents. AI systems in the area of migration, asylum and border
control management covered by this Regulation should comply with the relevant
procedural requirements set by the Directive 2013/32/EU of the European Parliament and
of the Council20, the Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 of the European Parliament and of the
Council21 and other relevant legislation. The use of AI systems in migration, asylum and
border control management should in no circumstances be used by Member States or
Union institutions, agencies or bodies as a means to circumvent their international
obligations under the Convention of 28 July 1951 relating to the Status of Refugees as
amended by the Protocol of 31 January 1967, nor should they be used to in any way
infringe on the principle of non-refoulement, or deny safe and effective legal avenues into
the territory of the Union, including the right to international protection.

(40) Certain AI systems intended for the administration of justice and democratic processes
should be classified as high-risk, considering their potentially significant impact on
democracy, rule of law, individual freedoms as well as the right to an effective remedy and
to a fair trial. In particular, to address the risks of potential biases, errors and opacity, it is
appropriate to qualify as high-risk AI systems intended to be used by a judicial authority or
on its behalf to assist judicial authorities in researching and interpreting facts and the law
and in applying the law to a concrete set of facts. AI systems intended to be used by
alternative dispute resolution bodies for those purposes should also be considered high-risk
when the outcomes of the alternative dispute resolution proceedings produce legal effects
for the parties. The use of artificial intelligence tools can supportthe decision-making
power of judges or judicial independence, but should not replace it, as the final decisionmaking must remain a human-driven activity and decision. Such qualification should not
extend, however, to AI systems intended for purely ancillary administrative activities that
do not affect the actual administration of justice in individual cases, such as anonymisation

(40a) Without prejudice to the rules provided for in [Regulation xxx on the transparency and
targeting of political advertising], and in order to address the risks of undue external
interference to the right to vote enshrined in Article 39 of the Charter, and of adverse
effects on democracy, and the rule of law, AI systems intended to be used to influence the
outcome of an election or referendum or the voting behaviour of natural persons in the
exercise of their vote in elections or referenda should be classified as high-risk AI systems
with the exception of AI systems whose output natural persons are not directly exposed to,
such as tools used to organise, optimise and structure political campaigns from an
administrative and logistical point of view.

(41) The fact that an AI system is classified as a high risk AI system under this Regulation
should not be interpreted as indicating that the use of the system is lawful under other acts
of Union law or under national law compatible with Union law, such as on the protection
of personal data, on the use of polygraphs and similar tools or other systems to detect the
emotional state of natural persons. Any such use should continue to occur solely in
accordance with the applicable requirements resulting from the Charter and from the
applicable acts of secondary Union law and national law. This Regulation should not be
understood as providing for the legal ground for processing of personal data, including
special categories of personal data, where relevant, unless it is specifically provided for
otherwise in this Regulation.

(42) To mitigate the risks from high-risk AI systems placed on the market or put into service
and to ensure a high level of trustworthiness, certain mandatory requirements should apply
to high risk AI systems, taking into account the intended purpose and the context of use of
the AI system and according to the risk management system to be established by the
provider. The measures adopted by the providers to comply with the mandatory
requirements of this Regulation should take into account the generally acknowledge state
of the art on artificial intelligence, be proportionate and effective to meet the objectives of
this Regulation. Following the New Legislative Framework approach, as clarified in
Commission notice the ‘Blue Guide’ on the implementation of EU product rules 2022
(C/2022/3637), the general rule is that several pieces of the EU legislation may have to be
taken into consideration for one product, since the making available or putting into service
can only take place when the product complies with all applicable Union harmonisation 
legislation. Hazards of AI systems covered by the requirements of this Regulation concern
different aspects than the existing Union harmonisation acts and therefore the requirements
of this Regulation would complement the existing body of the Union harmonisation acts.
For example, machinery or medical devices products incorporating an AI system might
present risks not addressed by the essential health and safety requirements set out in the
relevant Union harmonised legislation, as this sectoral legislation does not deal with risks
specific to AI systems. This calls for a simultaneous and complementary application of the
various legislative acts. To ensure consistency and avoid unnecessary administrative
burden or costs, providers of a product that contains one or more high-risk artificial
intelligence system, to which the requirements of this Regulation as well as requirements
of the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex II, Section A apply, should have a
flexibility on operational decisions on how to ensure compliance of a product that contains
one or more artificial intelligence systems with all applicable requirements of the Union
harmonised legislation in a best way. This flexibility could mean, for example a decision
by the provider to integrate a part of the necessary testing and reporting processes,
information and documentation required under this Regulation into already existing
documentation and procedures required under the existing Union harmonisation legislation
listed in Annex II, Section A. This however should not in any way undermine the
obligation of the provider to comply with all the applicable requirements.

(42a) The risk management system should consist of a continuous, iterative process that is
planned and run throughout the entire lifecycle of a high-risk AI system. This process
should be aimed at identifying and mitigating the relevant risks of artificial intelligence
systems on health, safety and fundamental rights. The risk management system should be
regularly reviewed and updated to ensure its continuing effectiveness, as well as
justification and documentation of any significant decisions and actions taken subject to
this Regulation. This process should ensure that the provider identifies risks or adverse
impacts and implements mitigation measures for the known and reasonably foreseeable
risks of artificial intelligence systems to the health, safety and fundamental rights in light
of its intended purpose and reasonably foreseeable misuse, including the possible risks
arising from the interaction between the AI system and the environment within which it
operates. The risk management system should adopt the most appropriate risk
management measures in the light of the state of the art in AI. When identifyingthe most
appropriate risk management measures, the provider should document and explain the
choices made and, when relevant, involve experts and external stakeholders. In identifying 
reasonably foreseeable misuse of high risk AI systems the provider should cover uses of the
AI systems which, while not directly covered by the intended purpose and provided for in
the instruction for use may nevertheless be reasonably expected to result from readily
predictable human behaviour in the context of the specific characteristics and use of the
particular AI system. Any known or foreseeable circumstances, related to the use of the
high-risk AI system in accordance with its intended purpose or under conditions of
reasonably foreseeable misuse, which may lead to risks to the health and safety or
fundamental rights should be included in the instructions for use provided by the provider.
This is to ensure that the deployer is aware and takes them into account when using the
high-risk AI system. Identifying and implementing risk mitigation measures for foreseeable
misuse under this Regulation should not require specific additional training measures for
the high-risk AI system by the provider to address them. The providers however are
encouraged to consider such additional training measures to mitigate reasonable
foreseeable misuses as necessary and appropriate.

(43) Requirements should apply to high-risk AI systems as regards risk management, the
quality and relevance of data sets used, technical documentation and record-keeping,
transparency and the provision of information to deployers , human oversight, and
robustness, accuracy and cybersecurity. Those requirements are necessary to effectively
mitigate the risks for health, safety and fundamental rights, , and no other less trade
restrictive measures are reasonably available, thus avoiding unjustified restrictions to trade.

(44) High quality data and access to high quality data plays a vital role in providing structure
and in ensuring the performance of many AI systems, especially when techniques
involving the training of models are used, with a view to ensure that the high-risk AI
system performs as intended and safely and it does not become a source of discrimination
prohibited by Union law. High quality datasets for training, validation and testing require
the implementation of appropriate data governance and management practices. Datasets for
training, validation and testing, including the labels, should be relevant, sufficiently
representative, and to the best extent possible free of errors and complete in view of the
intended purpose of the system. In order to facilitate compliance with EU data protection
law, such as Regulation (EU) 2016/679, data governance and management practices
should include, in the case of personal data, transparency about the original purpose of the
data collection, The datasets should also have the appropriate statistical properties,
including as regards the persons or groups of persons in relation to whom the high-risk AI
system is intended to be used, with specific attention to the mitigation of possible biases in 
the datasets, that are likely to affect the health and safety of persons, negatively impact
fundamental rights or lead to discrimination prohibited under Union law, especially where
data outputs influence inputs for future operations (‘feedback loops’) . Biases can for
example be inherent in underlying datasets, especially when historical data is being used,
or generated when the systems are implemented in real world settings. Results provided by
AI systems could be influenced by such inherent biases that are inclined to gradually
increase and thereby perpetuate and amplify existing discrimination, in particular for
persons belonging to certain vulnerable groups including racial or ethnic groups. The
requirement for the datasets to be to the best extent possible complete and free of errors
should not affect the use of privacy-preserving techniques in the context of the development
and testing of AI systems. In particular, datasets should take into account, to the extent
required by their intended purpose, the features, characteristics or elements that are
particular to the specific geographical, contextual, behavioural or functional setting which
the AI system is intended to be used. The requirements related to data governance can be
complied with by having recourse to third-parties that offer certified compliance services
including verification of data governance, data set integrity, and data training, validation
and testing practices, as far as compliance with the data requirements of this Regulation
are ensured.

(45) For the development and assessment of high-risk AI systems, certain actors, such as
providers, notified bodies and other relevant entities, such as digital innovation hubs,
testing experimentation facilities and researchers, should be able to access and use high
quality datasets within their respective fields of activities which are related to this
Regulation. European common data spaces established by the Commission and the
facilitation of data sharing between businesses and with government in the public interest
will be instrumental to provide trustful, accountable and non-discriminatory access to high
quality data for the training, validation and testing of AI systems. For example, in health,
the European health data space will facilitate non-discriminatory access to health data and
the training of artificial intelligence algorithms on those datasets, in a privacy-preserving,
secure, timely, transparent and trustworthy manner, and with an appropriate institutional
governance. Relevant competent authorities, including sectoral ones, providing or
supporting the access to data may also support the provision of high-quality data for the
training, validation and testing of AI systems.

(45a) The right to privacy and to protection of personal data must be guaranteed throughout the
entire lifecycle of the AI system. In this regard, the principles of data minimisation and 
data protection by design and by default, as set out in Union data protection law, are
applicable when personal data are processed. Measures taken by providers to ensure
compliance with those principles may include not only anonymisation and encryption, but
also the use of technology that permits algorithms to be brought to the data and allows
training of AI systems without the transmission between parties or copying of the raw or
structured data themselves, without prejudice to the requirements on data governance
provided for in this Regulation.

44c In order to protect the right of others from the discrimination that might result from the
bias in AI systems, the providers should, exceptionally, to the extent that it is strictly
necessary for the purposes of ensuring bias detection and correction in relation to the
high-risk AI systems, subject to appropriate safeguards for the fundamental rights and
freedoms of natural persons and following the application of all applicable conditions laid
down under this Regulation in addition to the conditions laid down in Regulation (EU)
2016/679, Directive (EU) 2016/680 and Regulation (EU) 2018/1725,be able to process
also special categories of personal data, as a matter of substantial public interest within the
meaning of Article 9(2)(g) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Article 10(2)g) of Regulation
(EU) 2018/1725.

(46) Having comprehensible information on how high-risk AI systems have been developed
and how they perform throughout their lifetime is essential to enable traceability of those
systems, verify compliance with the requirements under this Regulation, as well as
monitoring of their operations and post market monitoring. This requires keeping records
and the availability of a technical documentation, containing information which is
necessary to assess the compliance of the AI system with the relevant requirements and
facilitate post market monitoring. Such information should include the general
characteristics, capabilities and limitations of the system, algorithms, data, training, testing
and validation processes used as well as documentation on the relevant risk management
system and drawn in a clear and comprehensive form. The technical documentation should
be kept up to date, appropriately throughout the lifetime of the AI system. Furthermore,
high risk AI systems should technically allow for automatic recording of events (logs) over
the duration of the lifetime of the system.

(47) To address concerns related to opacity and complexity of certain AI systems and help
deployers to fulfil their obligations under this Regulation, transparency should be required
for high-risk AI systems before they are placed on the market or put it into service. High-
risk AI systems should be designed in a manner to enable deployers to understand how the
AI system works, evaluate its functionality, and comprehend its strengths and limitations.
High risk AI systems, should be accompanied by appropriate information in the form of
instructions of use. Such information should include the characteristics, capabilities and
limitations of performance of the AI system. These would cover information on possible
known and foreseeable circumstances related to the use of the high-risk AI system,
including deployer action that may influence system behaviour and performance, under
which the AI system can lead to risks to health, safety, and fundamental rights, on the
changes that have been pre-determined and assessed for conformity by the provider and on
the relevant human oversight measures, including the measures to facilitate the
interpretation of the outputs of the AI system by the deployers. Transparency, including the
accompanying instructions for use, should assist deployers in the use of the system and
support informed decision making by them. Among others, deployers should be in a better
position to make the correct choice of the system they intend to use in the light of the
obligations applicable to them, be educated about the intended and precluded uses, and use
the AI system correctly and as appropriate. In order to enhance legibility and accessibility
of the information included in the instructions of use, where appropriate, illustrative
examples, for instance on the limitations and on the intended and precluded uses of the AI
system, should be included. Providers should ensure that all documentation, including the
instructions for use, contains meaningful, comprehensive, accessible and understandable
information, taking into account the needs and foreseeable knowledge of the target
deployers. Instructions for use should be made available in a language which can be easily
understood by target deployers, as determined by the Member State concerned.

(48) High-risk AI systems should be designed and developed in such a way that natural persons
can oversee their functioning, ensure that they are used as intended and that their impacts
are addressed over the system’s lifecycle. For this purpose, appropriate human oversight
measures should be identified by the provider of the system before its placing on the
market or putting into service. In particular, where appropriate, such measures should
guarantee that the system is subject to in-built operational constraints that cannot be
overridden by the system itself and is responsive to the human operator, and that the
natural persons to whom human oversight has been assigned have the necessary
competence, training and authority to carry out that role. It is also essential, as appropriate,
to ensure that high-risk AI systems include mechanisms to guide and inform a natural
person to whom human oversight has been assigned to make informed decisions if, when 
and how to intervene in order to avoid negative consequences or risks, or stop the system if
it does not perform as intended. Considering the significant consequences for persons in
case of incorrect matches by certain biometric identification systems, it is appropriate to
provide for an enhanced human oversight requirement for those systems so that no action
or decision may be taken by the deployer on the basis of the identification resulting from
the system unless this has been separately verified and confirmed by at least two natural
persons. Those persons could be from one or more entities and include the person
operating or using the system. This requirement should not pose unnecessary burden or
delays and it could be sufficient that the separate verifications by the different persons are
automatically recorded in the logs generated by the system. Given the specificities of the
areas of law enforcement, migration, border control and asylum, this requirement should
not apply in cases where Union or national law considers the application of this
requirement to be disproportionate.

(49) High-risk AI systems should perform consistently throughout their lifecycle and meet an
appropriate level of accuracy, robustness and cybersecurity, in the light of their intended
purpose and in accordance with the generally acknowledged state of the art. The
Commission and relevant organisations and stakeholders are encouraged to take due
consideration of mitigation of risks and negative impacts of the AI system. The expected
level of performance metrics should be declared in the accompanying instructions of use.
Providers are urged to communicate this information to deployers in a clear and easily
understandable way, free of misunderstandings or misleading statements. The EU
legislation on legal metrology, including on Measuring Instruments Directive (MID) and
Non-automatic weighing instruments (NAWI) Directive, aims to ensure the accuracy of
measurements and to help the transparency and fairness of commercial transactions. In
this context, in cooperation with relevant stakeholders and organisation, such as
metrology and benchmarking authorities, the Commission should encourage, as
appropriate, the development of benchmarks and measurement methodologies for AI
systems. In doing so, the Commission should take note and collaborate with international
partners working on metrology and relevant measurement indicators relating to Artificial
Intelligence.

(50) The technical robustness is a key requirement for high-risk AI systems. They should be
resilient in relation to harmful or otherwise undesirable behaviour that may result from
limitations within the systems or the environment in which the systems operate (e.g. errors,
faults, inconsistencies, unexpected situations). Therefore, technical and organisational 
measures should be taken to ensure robustness of high-risk AI systems, for example by
designing and developing appropriate technical solutions to prevent or minimize harmful
or otherwise undesirable behaviour. Those technical solution may include for instance
mechanisms enabling the system to safely interrupt its operation (fail-safe plans) in the
presence of certain anomalies or when operation takes place outside certain predetermined
boundaries. Failure to protect against these risks could lead to safety impacts or negatively
affect the fundamental rights, for example due to erroneous decisions or wrong or biased
outputs generated by the AI system.

(51) Cybersecurity plays a crucial role in ensuring that AI systems are resilient against attempts
to alter their use, behaviour, performance or compromise their security properties by
malicious third parties exploiting the system’s vulnerabilities. Cyberattacks against AI
systems can leverage AI specific assets, such as training data sets (e.g. data poisoning) or
trained models (e.g. adversarial attacks or membership inference), or exploit vulnerabilities
in the AI system’s digital assets or the underlying ICT infrastructure. To ensure a level of
cybersecurity appropriate to the risks, suitable measures, such as security controls, should
therefore be taken by the providers of high-risk AI systems, also taking into account as
appropriate the underlying ICT infrastructure.

(51a) Without prejudice to the requirements related to robustness and accuracy set out in this
Regulation, high-risk AI systems which fall within the scope of the Regulation 2022/0272,
in accordance with Article 8 of the the Regulation 2022/0272 may demonstrate
compliance with the cybersecurity requirement of this Regulation by fulfilling the essential
cybersecurity requirements set out in Article 10 and Annex I of the Regulation
2022/0272.When high-risk AI systems fulfil the essential requirements of Regulation
2022/0272, they should be deemed compliant with the cybersecurity requirements set out
in this Regulation in so far as the achievement of those requirements is demonstrated in the
EU declaration of conformity or parts thereof issued under Regulation 2022/0272. For this
purpose, the assessment of the cybersecurity risks, associated to a product with digital
elements classified as high-risk AI system according to this Regulation, carried out under
Regulation 2022/0272, should consider risks to the cyber resilience of an AI system as
regards attempts by unauthorised third parties to alter its use, behaviour or performance,
including AI specific vulnerabilities such as data poisoning or adversarial attacks, as well
as, as relevant, risks to fundamental rights as required by this Regulation.
The conformity assessment procedure provided by this Regulation should apply in relation
to the essential cybersecurity requirements of a product with digital elements covered by 
Regulation 2022/0272 and classified as a high-risk AI system under this Regulation.
However, this rule should not result in reducing the necessary level of assurance for critical
products with digital elements covered by Regulation 2022/0272. Therefore, by way of
derogation from this rule, high-risk AI systems that fall within the scope of this Regulation
and are also qualified as important and critical products with digital elements pursuant to
Regulation 2022/0272 and to which the conformity assessment procedure based on internal
control referred to in Annex VI of this Regulation applies, are subject to the conformity
assessment provisions of Regulation 2022/0272 insofar as the essential cybersecurity
requirements of Regulation 2022/0272 are concerned. In this case, for all the other aspects
covered by this Regulation the respective provisions on conformity assessment based on
internal control set out in Annex VI of this Regulation should apply. Building on the
knowledge and expertise of ENISA on the cybersecurity policy and tasks assigned to
ENISA under the Regulation 2019/1020 the European Commission should cooperate with
ENISA on issues related to cybersecurity of AI systems.

(52) As part of Union harmonisation legislation, rules applicable to the placing on the market,
putting into service and use of high-risk AI systems should be laid down consistently with
Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council22 setting out
the requirements for accreditation and the market surveillance of products, Decision No
768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council23 on a common framework
for the marketing of products and Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 of the European Parliament
and of the Council24 on market surveillance and compliance of products (‘New Legislative
Framework for the marketing of products’).

(53) It is appropriate that a specific natural or legal person, defined as the provider, takes the
responsibility for the placing on the market or putting into service of a high-risk AI system,
regardless of whether that natural or legal person is the person who designed or developed
the system.

(53a) As signatories to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
(UNCRPD), the Union and the Member States are legally obliged to protect persons with
disabilities from discrimination and promote their equality, to ensure that persons with
disabilities have access, on an equal basis with others, to information and communications
technologies and systems, and to ensure respect for privacy for persons with disabilities.
Given the growing importance and use of AI systems, the application of universal design
principles to all new technologies and services should ensure full and equal access for
everyone potentially affected by or using AI technologies, including persons with
disabilities, in a way that takes full account of their inherent dignity and diversity. It is
therefore essential that Providers ensure full compliance with accessibility requirements,
including Directive (EU) 2016/2102 and Directive (EU) 2019/882. Providers should
ensure compliance with these requirements by design. Therefore, the necessary measures
should be integrated as much as possible into the design of the high-risk AI system.

(54) The provider should establish a sound quality management system, ensure the
accomplishment of the required conformity assessment procedure, draw up the relevant
documentation and establish a robust post-market monitoring system. Providers of high
risk AI systems that are subject to obligations regarding quality management systems
under relevant sectorial Union law should have the possibility to include the elements of
the quality management system provided for in this Regulation as part of the existing
quality management system provided for in that other sectorial Union legislation. The
complementarity between this Regulation and existing sectorial Union law should also be
taken into account in future standardization activities or guidance adopted by the
Commission. Public authorities which put into service high-risk AI systems for their own
use may adopt and implement the rules for the quality management system as part of the
quality management system adopted at a national or regional level, as appropriate, taking
into account the specificities of the sector and the competences and organisation of the
public authority in question.

(56) To enable enforcement of this Regulation and create a level-playing field for operators, and
taking into account the different forms of making available of digital products, it is
important to ensure that, under all circumstances, a person established in the Union can
provide authorities with all the necessary information on the compliance of an AI system.
Therefore, prior to making their AI systems available in the Union, providers established 
outside the Union shall, by written mandate, appoint an authorised representative
established in the Union. This authorised representative plays a pivotal role in ensuring
the compliance of the high-risk AI systems placed on the market or put into service in the
Union by those providers who are not established in the Union and in serving as their
contact person established in the Union.

(56a) In the light of the nature and complexity of the value chain for AI systems and in line with
New Legislative Framework principles, it is essential to ensure legal certainty and facilitate
the compliance with this Regulation. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the role and the
specific obligations of relevant operators along the value chain, such as importers and
distributors who may contribute to the development of AI systems. In certain situations
those operators could act in more than one role at the same time and should therefore fulfil
cumulatively all relevant obligations associated with those roles. For example, an operator
could act as a distributor and an importer at the same time.

(57) To ensure legal certainty, it is necessary to clarify that, under certain specific conditions,
any distributor, importer, deployer or other third-party should be considered a provider of
a high-risk AI system and therefore assume all the relevant obligations. This would be the
case if that party puts its name or trademark on a high-risk AI system already placed on the
market or put into service, without prejudice to contractual arrangements stipulating that
the obligations are allocated otherwise, or if that party make a substantial modification to a
high-risk AI system that has already been placed on the market or has already been put into
service and in a way that it remains a high-risk AI system in accordance with Article 6, or
if it modifies the intended purpose of an AI system, including a general purpose AI system,
which has not been classified as high-risk and has already been placed on the market or
put into service, in a way that the AI system becomes a high-risk AI system in accordance
with Article 6. These provisions should apply without prejudice to more specific
provisions established in certain New Legislative Framework sectorial legislation with
which this Regulation should apply jointly. For example, Article 16, paragraph 2 of
Regulation 745/2017, establishing that certain changes should not be considered
modifications of a device that could affect its compliance with the applicable requirements,
should continue to apply to high-risk AI systems that are medical devices within the
meaning of that Regulation.

(57a) General purpose AI systems may be used as high-risk AI systems by themselves or be
components of other high risk AI systems. Therefore, due to their particular nature and in 
order to ensure a fair sharing of responsibilities along the AI value chain, the providers of
such systems should, irrespective of whether they may be used as high-risk AI systems as
such by other providers or as components of high-risk AI systems and unless provided
otherwise under this Regulation, closely cooperate with the providers of the respective
high-risk AI systems to enable their compliance with the relevant obligations under this
Regulation and with the competent authorities established under this Regulation.

(57b) Where, under the conditions laid down in this Regulation, the provider that initially placed
the AI system on the market or put it into service should no longer be considered the
provider for the purposes of this Regulation, and when that provider has not expressly
excluded the change of the AI system into a high-risk AI system, the former provider
should nonetheless closely cooperate and make available the necessary information and
provide the reasonably expected technical access and other assistance that are required for
the fulfilment of the obligations set out in this Regulation, in particular regarding the
compliance with the conformity assessment of high-risk AI systems.

(57c) In addition, where a high-risk AI system that is a safety component of a product which is
covered by a relevant New Legislative Framework sectorial legislation is not placed on the
market or put into service independently from the product, the product manufacturer as
defined under the relevant New Legislative Framework legislation should comply with the
obligations of the provider established in this Regulation and notably ensure that the AI
system embedded in the final product complies with the requirements of this Regulation.

(57d) Within the AI value chain multiple parties often supply AI systems, tools and services but
also components or processes that are incorporated by the provider into the AI system
withvarious objectives , includingthe model training, model retraining, model testing and
evaluation, integration into software, or other aspects of model development. These
parties have an important role in the value chain towards the provider of the high-risk AI
system into which their AI systems, tools, services, components or processes are
integrated, and should provide by written agreement this provider with the necessary
information, capabilities, technical access and other assistance based on the generally
acknowledged state of the art, in order to enable the provider to fully comply with the
obligations set out in this Regulation, without compromising their own intellectual
property rights or trade secrets.

(57e) Third parties making accessible to the public tools, services, processes, or AI components
other than general-purpose AI models, shall not be mandated to comply with requirements 
targeting the responsibilities along the AI value chain, in particuliar towards the provider
that has used or integrated them, when those tools, services, processes, or AI components
are made accessible under a free and open licence. Developers of free and open-source
tools, services, processes, or AI components other than general-purpose AI models should
be encouraged to implement widely adopted documentation practices, such as model cards
and data sheets, as a way to accelerate information sharing along the AI value chain,
allowing the promotion of trustworthy AI systems in the Union.

(57f) The Commission could develop and recommend voluntary model contractual terms
between providers of high-risk AI systems and third parties that supply tools, services,
components or processes that are used or integrated in high-risk AI systems, to facilitate
the cooperation along the value chain. When developing voluntary model contractual
terms, the Commission should also take into account possible contractual requirements
applicable in specific sectors or business cases.

(58) Given the nature of AI systems and the risks to safety and fundamental rights possibly
associated with their use, including as regards the need to ensure proper monitoring of the
performance of an AI system in a real-life setting, it is appropriate to set specific
responsibilities for deployers . Deployers should in particular take appropriate technical
and organisational measures to ensure they use high-risk AI systems in accordance with
the instructions of use and certain other obligations should be provided for with regard to
monitoring of the functioning of the AI systems and with regard to record-keeping, as
appropriate. Furthermore, deployers should ensure that the persons assigned to implement
the instructions for use and human oversight as set out in this Regulation have the
necessary competence, in particular an adequate level of AI literacy, training and authority
to properly fulfil those tasks. These obligations should be without prejudice to other
deployer obligations in relation to high-risk AI systems under Union or national law.

(58b) This Regulation is without prejudice to obligations for employers to inform or to inform
and consult workers or their representatives under Union or national law and practice,
including directive 2002/14/EC on a general framework for informing and consulting
employees, on decisions to put into service or use AI systems. It remains necessary to
ensure information of workers and their representatives on the planned deployment of
high-risk AI systems at the workplace in cases where the conditions for those information
or information and consultation obligations in other legal instruments are not fulfilled.
Moreover, such information right is ancillary and necessary to the objective of protecting 
fundamental rights that underlies this Regulation. Therefore, an information requirement
to that effect should be laid down in this regulation, without affecting any existing rights of
workers.

(58b) Whilst risks related to AI systems can result from the way such systems are designed, risks
can as well stem from how such AI systems are used. Deployers of high-risk AI system
therefore play a critical role in ensuring that fundamental rights are protected,
complementing the obligations of the provider when developing the AI system. Deployers
are best placed to understand how the high-risk AI system will be used concretely and can
therefore identify potential significant risks that were not foreseen in the development
phase, due to a more precise knowledge of the context of use, the people or groups of
people likely to be affected, including vulnerable groups. Deployers of high risk AI
systems referred to in Annex III also play a critical role in informing natural persons and
should, when they make decisions or assist in making decisions related to natural persons ,
where applicable, inform the natural persons that they are subject to the use of the high
risk AI system. This information should include the intended purpose and the type of
decisions it makes. The deployer should also inform the natural person about its right to an
explanation provided under this Regulation. With regard to high risk AI systems used for
law enforcement purposes, this obligation should be implemented in accordance with
Article 13 of Directive 2016/680.

(58d) Any processing of biometric data involved in the use of AI systems for biometric
identification for the purpose of law enforcement needs to comply with Article 10 of
Directive (EU) 2016/680, that allows such processing only where strictly necessary,
subject to appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of the data subject, and where
authorised by Union or Member State law. Such use, when authorized, also needs to
respect the principles laid down in Article 4 paragraph 1 of Directive (EU) 2016/680
including lawfulness, fairness and transparency, purpose limitation, accuracy and storage
limitation.

(58e) Without prejudice to applicable Union law, notably the GDPR and Directive (EU)
2016/680 (the Law Enforcement Directive), considering the intrusive nature of post remote
biometric identification systems, the use of post remote biometric identification systems
shall be subject to safeguards. Post biometric identification systems should always be used
in a way that is proportionate, legitimate and strictly necessary, and thus targeted, in terms
of the individuals to be identified, the location, temporal scope and based on a closed 
dataset of legally acquired video footage. In any case, post remote biometric identification
systems should not be used in the framework of law enforcement to lead to indiscriminate
surveillance. The conditions for post remote biometric identification should in any case not
provide a basis to circumvent the conditions of the prohibition and strict exceptions for real
time remote biometric identification

(58g) In order to efficiently ensure that fundamental rights are protected, deployers of high-risk
AI systems that are bodies governed by public law, or private operators providing public
services and operators deploying certain high-risk AI system referred to in Annex III, such
as banking or insurance entities, should carry out a fundamental rights impact assessment
prior to putting it into use . Services important for individuals that are of public nature
may also be provided by private entities. Private operators providing such services of
public nature are linked to tasks in the public interest such as in the area of education,
healthcare, social services, housing,administration of justice. The aim of the fundamental
rights impact assessment is for the deployer to identify the specific risks to the rights of
individuals or groups of individuals likely to be affected, identify measures to be taken in
case of the materialisation of these risk.The impact assessment should apply to the first use
of the high-risk AI system, and should be updated when the deployer considers that any of
the relevant factors have changed. The impact assessment should identify the deployer’s
relevant processes in which the high-risk AI system will be used in line with its intended
purpose, and should include a description of the period of time and frequency in which the
system is intended to be used as well as of specific categories of natural persons and
groups who are likely to be affected in the specific context of use. The assessment should
also include the identification of specific risks of harm likely to impact the fundamental
rights of these persons or groups. While performing this assessment, the deployer should
take into account information relevant to a proper assessment of impact, including but not
limited to the information given by the provider of the high-risk AI system in the
instructions for use. In light of the risks identified, deployers should determine measures to
be taken in case of the materialization of these risks, including for example governance
arrangements in that specific context of use, such as arrangements for human oversight
according to the instructions of use or, complaint handling and redress procedures, as they
could be instrumental in mitigating risks to fundamental rights in concrete use-cases.
After performing this impact assessment, the deployer should notify the relevant market
surveillance authority. Where appropriate, to collect relevant information necessary to
perform the impact assessment, deployers of high-risk AI system, in particular when AI 
systems are used in the public sector, could involve relevant stakeholders, including the
representatives of groups of persons likely to be affected by the AI system, independent
experts, and civil society organisations in conducting such impact assessments and
designing measures to be taken in the case of materialization of the risks. The AI Office
should develop a template for a questionnaire in order to facilitate compliance and reduce
the administrative burden for deployers.

(60a) The notion of general-purpose AI models should be clearly defined and set apart from the
notion of AI systems to enable legal certainty. The definition should be based on the key
functional characteristics of a general-purpose AI model, in particular the generality and
the capability to competently perform a wide range of distinct tasks. These models are
typically trained on large amounts of data, through various methods, such as selfsupervised, unsupervised or reinforcement learning. General-purpose AI models may be
placed on the market in various ways, including through libraries, application
programming interfaces (APIs), as direct download, or as physical copy. These models
may be further modified or fine-tuned into new models. Although AI models are essential
components of AI systems, they do not constitute AI systems on their own. AI models
require the addition of further components, such as for example a user interface, to become
AI systems. AI models are typically integrated into and form part of AI systems. This
Regulation provides specific rules for general purpose AI models and for general purpose
AI models that pose systemic risks, which should apply also when these models are
integrated or form part of an AI system. It should be understood that the obligations for the
providers of general-purpose AI models should apply once the general-purpose AI models
are placed on the market. When the provider of a general-purpose AI model integrates an
own model into its own AI system that is made available on the market or put into service,
that model should be considered as being placed on the market and, therefore, the
obligations in this Regulation for models should continue to apply in addition to those for
AI systems. The obligations foreseen for models should in any case not apply when an own
model is used for purely internal processes that are not essential for providing a product or
a service to third parties and the rights of natural persons are not affected. Considering
their potential significantly negative effects, the general-purpose AI models with systemic
risk should always be subject to the relevant obligations under this Regulation. The 
definition should not cover AI models used before their placing on the market for the sole
purpose of research, development and prototyping activities. This is without prejudice to
the obligation to comply with this Regulation when, following such activities, a model is
placed on the market.

(60b) Whereas the generality of a model could, among other criteria, also be determined by a
number of parameters, models with at least a billion of parameters and trained with a large
amount of data using self-supervision at scale should be considered as displaying
significant generality and competently performing a wide range of distinctive tasks.

(60c) Large generative AI models are a typical example for a general-purpose AI model, given
that they allow for flexible generation of content (such as in the form of text, audio, images
or video) that can readily accommodate a wide range of distinctive tasks.

(60d) When a general-purpose AI model is integrated into or forms part of an AI system, this
system should be considered a general-purpose AI system when, due to this integration,
this system has the capability to serve a variety of purposes. A general-purpose AI system
can be used directly, or it may be integrated into other AI systems.

(60e) Providers of general-purpose AI models have a particular role and responsibility in the AI
value chain, as the models they provide may form the basis for a range of downstream
systems, often provided by downstream providers that necessitate a good understanding of
the models and their capabilities, both to enable the integration of such models into their
products, and to fulfil their obligations under this or other regulations. Therefore,
proportionate transparency measures should be foreseen, including the drawing up and
keeping up to date of documentation, and the provision of information on the general
purpose AI model for its usage by the downstream providers. Technical documentation
should be prepared and kept up to date by the general purpose AI model provider for the
purpose of making it available, upon request, to the AI Office and the national competent
authorities. The minimal set of elements contained in such documentations should be
outlined, respectively, in Annex (XY) and Annex (XX). The Commission should be
enabled to amend the Annexes by delegated acts in the light of the evolving technological
developments.

(60i) Software and data, including models, released under a free and open-source licence that
allows them to be openly shared and where users can freely access, use, modify and
redistribute them or modified versions thereof, can contribute to research and innovation in 
the market and can provide significant growth opportunities for the Union economy.
General purpose AI models released under free and open-source licences should be
considered to ensure high levels of transparency and openness if their parameters,
including the weights, the information on the model architecture, and the information on
model usage are made publicly available. The licence should be considered free and opensource also when it allows users to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve
software and data, including models under the condition that the original provider of the
model is credited, the identical or comparable terms of distribution are respected.

(60i+1) Free and open-source AI components covers the software and data, including
models and general purpose AI models, tools, services or processes of an AI system. Free
and open-source AI components can be provided through different channels, including
their development on open repositories. For the purpose of this Regulation, AI components
that are provided against a price or otherwise monetised, including through the provision of
technical support or other services, including through a software platform, related to the AI
component, or the use of personal data for reasons other than exclusively for improving the
security, compatibility or interoperability of the software, with the exception of
transactions between micro enterprises, should not benefit from the exceptions provided to
free and open source AI components. The fact of making AI components available through
open repositories should not, in itself, constitute a monetisation.

(60f) The providers of general purpose AI models that are released under a free and open source
license, and whose parameters, including the weights, the information on the model
architecture, and the information on model usage, are made publicly available should be
subject to exceptions as regards the transparency-related requirements imposed on general
purpose AI models, unless they can be considered to present a systemic risk, in which case
the circumstance that the model is transparent and accompanied by an open source license
should not be considered a sufficient reason to exclude compliance with the obligations
under this Regulation.

In any case, given that the release of general purpose AI models under free and open
source licence does not necessarily reveal substantial information on the dataset used for
the training or fine-tuning of the model and on how thereby the respect of copyright law
was ensured, the exception provided for general purpose AI models from compliance with
the tranparency-related requirements should not concern the obligation to produce a
summary about the content used for model training and the obligation to put in place a 
policy to respect Union copyright law in particular to identify and respect the reservations
of rights expressed pursuant to Article 4(3) of Directive (EU) 2019/790.

(60g) Compliance with the obligations foreseen for the providers of general-purpose AI models
should be commensurate and proportionate to the type of model provider, excluding the
need for compliance for persons who develop or use models for non-professional or
scientific research purposes, who should nevertheless be encouraged to voluntarily comply
with these requirements. Without prejudice to Union Copyright law, compliance with these
obligations should take due account of the size of the provider and allow simplified ways
of compliance for SMEs including start-ups, that should not represent an excessive cost
and not discourage the use of such models. In case of a modification or fine-tuning of a
model, the obligations for providers should be limited to that modification or fine-tuning,
for example by complementing the already existing technical documentation with
information on the modifications, including new training data sources, as a means to
comply with the value chain obligations provided in this Regulation.

(60i) General-purpose models, in particular large generative models, capable of generating text,
images, and other content, present unique innovation opportunities but also challenges to
artists, authors, and other creators and the way their creative content is created, distributed,
used and consumed. The development and training of such models require access to vast
amounts of text, images, videos, and other data. Text and data mining techniques may be
used extensively in this context for the retrieval and analysis of such content, which may
be protected by copyright and related rights. Any use of copyright protected content
requires the authorization of the rightholder concerned unless relevant copyright
exceptions and limitations apply. Directive (EU) 2019/790 introduced exceptions and
limitations allowing reproductions and extractions of works or other subject matter, for the
purposes of text and data mining, under certain conditions. Under these rules, rightholders
may choose to reserve their rights over their works or other subject matter to prevent text
and data mining, unless this is done for the purposes of scientific research. Where the
rights to opt out has been expressly reserved in an appropriate manner, providers of
general-purpose AI models need to obtain an authorisation from rightholders if they want
to carry out text and data mining over such works.

(60j) Providers that place general purpose AI models on the EU market should ensure
compliance with the relevant obligations in this Regulation. For this purpose, providers of
general purpose AI models should put in place a policy to respect Union law on copyright 
and related rights, in particular to identify and respect the reservations of rights expressed
by rightholders pursuant to Article 4(3) of Directive (EU) 2019/790. Any provider placing
a general purpose AI model on the EU market should comply with this obligation,
regardless of the jurisdiction in which the copyright-relevant acts underpinning the training
of these general purpose AI models take place. This is necessary to ensure a level playing
field among providers of general purpose AI models where no provider should be able to
gain a competitive advantage in the EU market by applying lower copyright standards than
those provided in the Union.

(60k) In order to increase transparency on the data that is used in the pre-training and training of
general purpose AI models, including text and data protected by copyright law, it is
adequate that providers of such models draw up and make publicly available a sufficiently
detailed summary of the content used for training the general purpose model. While taking
into due account the need to protect trade secrets and confidential business information,
this summary should be generally comprehensive in its scope instead of technically
detailed to facilitate parties with legitimate interests, including copyright holders, to
exercise and enforce their rights under Union law, for example by listing the main data
collections or sets that went into training the model, such as large private or public
databases or data archives, and by providing a narrative explanation about other data
sources used. It is appropriate for the AI Office to provide a template for the summary,
which should be simple, effective, and allow the provider to provide the required summary
in narrative form.

(60ka) With regard to the obligations imposed on providers of general-purpose AI models to put
in place a policy to respect Union copyright law and make publicly available a summary of
the content used for the training, the AI Office should monitor whether the provider has
fulfilled those obligations without verifying or proceeding to a work-by-work assessment
of the training data in terms of copyright compliance. This Regulation does not affect the
enforcement of copyright rules as provided for under Union law.

(60m) General-purpose AI models could pose systemic risks which include, but are not limited to,
any actual or reasonably foreseeable negative effects in relation to major accidents,
disruptions of critical sectors and serious consequences to public health and safety; any
actual or reasonably foreseeable negative effects on democratic processes, public and
economic security; the dissemination of illegal, false, or discriminatory content. Systemic
risks should be understood to increase with model capabilities and model reach, can arise 
along the entire lifecycle of the model, and are influenced by conditions of misuse, model
reliability, model fairness and model security, the degree of autonomy of the model, its
access to tools, novel or combined modalities, release and distribution strategies, the
potential to remove guardrails and other factors. In particular, international approaches
have so far identified the need to devote attention to risks from potential intentional misuse
or unintended issues of control relating to alignment with human intent; chemical,
biological, radiological, and nuclear risks, such as the ways in which barriers to entry can
be lowered, including for weapons development, design acquisition, or use; offensive
cyber capabilities, such as the ways in vulnerability discovery, exploitation, or operational
use can be enabled; the effects of interaction and tool use, including for example the
capacity to control physical systems and interfere with critical infrastructure; risks from
models of making copies of themselves or “self-replicating” or training other models; the
ways in which models can give rise to harmful bias and discrimination with risks to
individuals, communities or societies; the facilitation of disinformation or harming privacy
with threats to democratic values and human rights; risk that a particular event could lead
to a chain reaction with considerable negative effects that could affect up to an entire city,
an entire domain activity or an entire community.

(60n) It is appropriate to establish a methodology for the classification of general-purpose AI
models as general-purpose AI model with systemic risks. Since systemic risks result from
particularly high capabilities, a general-purpose AI models should be considered to present
systemic risks if it has high-impact capabilities, evaluated on the basis of appropriate
technical tools and methodologies, or significant impact on the internal market due to its
reach. High-impact capabilities in general purpose AI models means capabilities that
match or exceed the capabilities recorded in the most advanced general-purpose AI
models. The full range of capabilities in a model could be better understood after its release
on the market or when users interact with the model. According to the state of the art at the
time of entry into force of this Regulation, the cumulative amount of compute used for the
training of the general-purpose AI model measured in floating point operations (FLOPs) is
one of the relevant approximations for model capabilities. The amount of compute used for
training cumulates the compute used across the activities and methods that are intended to
enhance the capabilities of the model prior to deployment, such as pre-training, synthetic
data generation and fine-tuning. Therefore, an initial threshold of FLOPs should be set,
which, if met by a general-purpose AI model, leads to a presumption that the model is a
general-purpose AI model with systemic risks. This threshold should be adjusted over time 
to reflect technological and industrial changes, such as algorithmic improvements or
increased hardware efficiency, and should be supplemented with benchmarks and
indicators for model capability. To inform this, the AI Office should engage with the
scientific community, industry, civil society and other experts. Thresholds, as well as tools
and benchmarks for the assessment of high-impact capabilities, should be strong predictors
of generality, its capabilities and associated systemic risk of general-purpose AI models,
and could take into taking into account the way the model will be placed on the market or
the number of users it may affect. To complement this system, there should be a possibility
for the Commission to take individual decisions designating a general-purpose AI model as
a general-purpose AI model with systemic risk if it is found that such model has
capabilities or impact equivalent to those captured by the set threshold. This decision
should be taken on the basis of an overall assessment of the criteria set out in Annex YY,
such as quality or size of the training data set, number of business and end users, its input
and output modalities, its degree of autonomy and scalability, or the tools it has access to.
Upon a reasoned request of a provider whose model has been designated as a generalpurpose AI model with systemic risk, the Commission should take the request into account
and may decide to reassess whether the general-purpose AI model can still be considered
to present systemic risks.

(60o) It is also necessary to clarify a procedure for the classification of a general purpose AI
model with systemic risks. A general purpose AI model that meets the applicable threshold
for high-impact capabilities should be presumed to be a general purpose AI models with
systemic risk. The provider should notify the AI Office at the latest two weeks after the
requirements are met or it becomes known that a general purpose AI model will meet the
requirements that lead to the presumption. This is especially relevant in relation to the
FLOP threshold because training of general purpose AI models takes considerable
planning which includes the upfront allocation of compute resources and, therefore,
providers of general purpose AI models are able to know if their model would meet the
threshold before the training is completed. In the context of this notification, the provider
should be able to demonstrate that because of its specific characteristics, a general purpose
AI model exceptionally does not present systemic risks, and that it thus should not be
classified as a general purpose AI model with systemic risks. This information is valuable
for the AI Office to anticipate the placing on the market of general purpose AI models with
systemic risks and the providers can start to engage with the AI Office early on. This is
especially important with regard to general-purpose AI models that are planned to be 
released as open-source, given that, after open-source model release, necessary measures to
ensure compliance with the obligations under this Regulation may be more difficult to
implement.

(60p) If the Commission becomes aware of the fact that a general-purpose AI model meets the
requirements to classify as a general-purpose model with systemic risk, which previously
had either not been known or of which the relevant provider has failed to notify the
Commission, the Commission should be empowered to designate it so. A system of
qualified alerts should ensure that the AI Office is made aware by the scientific panel of
general-purpose AI models that should possibly be classified as general-purpose AI models
with systemic risk, in addition to the monitoring activities of the AI Office.

(60q) The providers of general-purpose AI models presenting systemic risks should be subject, in
addition to the obligations provided for providers of general-purpose AI models, to
obligations aimed at identifying and mitigating those risks and ensuring an adequate level
of cybersecurity protection, regardless of whether it is provided as a standalone model or
embedded in an AI system or a product. To achieve these objectives, the Regulation should
require providers to perform the necessary model evaluations, in particular prior to its first
placing on the market, including conducting and documenting adversarial testing of
models, also, as appropriate, through internal or independent external testing. In addition,
providers of general-purpose AI models with systemic risks should continuously assess
and mitigate systemic risks, including for example by putting in place risk management
policies, such as accountability and governance processes, implementing post-market
monitoring, taking appropriate measures along the entire model’s lifecycle and cooperating
with relevant actors across the AI value chain.

(60r) Providers of general purpose AI models with systemic risks should assess and mitigate
possible systemic risks. If, despite efforts to identify and prevent risks related to a generalpurpose AI model that may present systemic risks, the development or use of the model
causes a serious incident, the general purpose AI model provider should without undue
delay keep track of the incident and report any relevant information and possible corrective
measures to the Commission and national competent authorities. Furthermore, providers
should ensure an adequate level of cybersecurity protection for the model and its physical
infrastructure, if appropriate, along the entire model lifecycle. Cybersecurity protection
related to systemic risks associated with malicious use of or attacks should duly consider
accidental model leakage, unsanctioned releases, circumvention of safety measures, and 
defence against cyberattacks, unauthorised access or model theft. This protection could be
facilitated by securing model weights, algorithms, servers, and datasets, such as through
operational security measures for information security, specific cybersecurity policies,
adequate technical and established solutions, and cyber and physical access controls,
appropriate to the relevant circumstances and the risks involved.

(60s) The AI Office should encourage and facilitate the drawing up, review and adaptation of
Codes of Practice, taking into account international approaches. All providers of generalpurpose AI models could be invited to participate. To ensure that the Codes of Practice
reflect the state of the art and duly take into account a diverse set of perspectives, the AI
Office should collaborate with relevant national competent authorities, and could, where
appropriate, consult with civil society organisations and other relevant stakeholders and
experts, including the Scientific Panel, for the drawing up of the Codes. Codes of Practice
should cover obligations for providers of general-purpose AI models and of generalpurpose models presenting systemic risks. In addition, as regards systemic risks, Codes of
Practice should help to establish a risk taxonomy of the type and nature of the systemic
risks at Union level, including their sources. Codes of practice should also be focused on
specific risk assessment and mitigation measures.

(60t) The Codes of Practice should represent a central tool for the proper compliance with the
obligations foreseen under this Regulation for providers of general-purpose AI models.
Providers should be able to rely on Codes of Practice to demonstrate compliance with the
obligations. By means of implementing acts, the Commission may decide to approve a
code of practice and give it a general validity within the Union, or, alternatively, to provide
common rules for the implementation of the relevant obligations, if, by the time the
Regulation becomes applicable, a Code of Practice cannot be finalised or is not deemed
adequate by the AI Office. Once a harmonised standard is published and assessed as
suitable to cover the relevant obligations by the AI Office, the compliance with a European
harmonised standard should grant providers the presumption of conformity. Providers of
general-purpose AI models should furthermore be able to demonstrate compliance using
alternative adequate means, if codes of practice or harmonized standards are not available,
or they choose not to rely on those.

(60u) This Regulation regulates AI systems and models by imposing certain requirements and
obligations for relevant market actors that are placing them on the market, putting into
service or use in the Union, thereby complementing obligations for providers of 
intermediary services that embed such systems or models into their services regulated by
Regulation (EU) 2022/2065. To the extent that such systems or models are embedded into
designated very large online platforms or very large online search engines, they are subject
to the risk management framework provided for in Regulation (EU) 2022/2065.

Consequently, the corresponding obligations of the AI Act should be presumed to be
fulfilled, unless significant systemic risks not covered by Regulation (EU) 2022/2065
emerge and are identified in such models. Within this framework, providers of very large
online platforms and very large search engines are obliged to assess potential systemic
risks stemming from the design, functioning and use of their services, including how the
design of algorithmic systems used in the service may contribute to such risks, as well as
systemic risks stemming from potential misuses. Those providers are also obliged to take
appropriate mitigating measures in observance of fundamental rights.

(60aa) Considering the quick pace of innovation and the technological evolution of digital
services in scope of different instruments of Union law in particular having in mind the
usage and the perception of their recipients, the AI systems subject to this Regulation may
be provided as intermediary services or parts thereof within the meaning of Regulation
(EU) 2022/2065, which should be interpreted in a technology-neutral manner. For
example, AI systems may be used to provide online search engines, in particular, to the
extent that an AI system such as an online chatbot performs searches of, in principle, all
websites, then incorporates the results into its existing knowledge and uses the updated
knowledge to generate a single output that combines different sources of information.

(60v) Furthermore, obligations placed on providers and deployers of certain AI systems in this
Regulation to enable the detection and disclosure that the outputs of those systems are
artificially generated or manipulated are particularly relevant to facilitate the effective
implementation of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065. This applies in particular as regards the
obligations of providers of very large online platforms or very large online search engines
to identify and mitigate systemic risks that may arise from the dissemination of content that
has been artificially generated or manipulated, in particular risk of the actual or foreseeable
negative effects on democratic processes, civic discourse and electoral processes, including
through disinformation.

(61) Standardisation should play a key role to provide technical solutions to providers to ensure
compliance with this Regulation, in line with the state of the art, to promote innovation as
well as competitiveness and growth in the single market. Compliance with harmonised 
standards as defined in Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of
the Council25, which are normally expected to reflect the state of the art,should be a means
for providers to demonstrate conformity with the requirements of this Regulation. A
balanced representation of interests involving all relevant stakeholders in the development
of standards, in particular SME’s, consumer organisations and environmental and social
stakeholders in accordance with Article 5 and 6 of Regulation 1025/2012 should therefore
be encouraged. In order to facilitate compliance, the standardisation requests should be
issued by the Commission without undue delay. When preparing the standardisation
request, the Commission should consult the AI advisory Forum and the Board in order to
collect relevant expertise.

However, In the absence of relevant references to harmonised standards, the Commission
should be able to establish, via implementing acts, and after consultation of the AI
Advisory forum, common specifications for certain requirements under this Regulation.
The common specification should be an exceptional fall back solution to facilitate the
provider’s obligation to comply with the requirements of this Regulation, when the
standardisation request has not been accepted by any of the European standardisation
organisations, or when the relevant harmonized standards insufficiently address
fundamental rights concerns, or when the harmonised standarts do not comply with the
request, or when there are delays in the adoption of an appropriate harmonised standard. If
such delay in the adoption of a harmonised standard is due to the technical complexity of
the standard in question, this should be considered by the Commission before
contemplating the establishment of common specifications. When developing common
specifications, the Commission is encouraged to cooperate with international partners and
international standardisation bodies.

(61a) It is appropriate that, without prejudice to the use of harmonised standards and common
specifications, providers of of high-risk AI system that has been trained and tested on data
reflecting the specific geographical, behavioural, contextual or functional setting within
which the AI system is intended to be used, should be presumed to be in compliance with
the respective measure provided for under the requirement on data governance set out in
this Regulation.

Without prejudice to the requirements related to robustness and accuracy set out in this
Regulation, in line with Article 54(3) of Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the European
Parliament and of the Council, high-risk AI systems that have been certified or for which a
statement of conformity has been issued under a cybersecurity scheme pursuant to that
Regulation and the references of which have been published in the Official Journal of the
European Union should be presumed to be in compliance with the cybersecurity
requirement of this Regulation in so far as the cybersecurity certificate or statement of
conformity or parts thereof cover the cybersecurity requirement of this Regulation This
remains without prejudice to the voluntary nature of that cybersecurity scheme.

(62) In order to ensure a high level of trustworthiness of high-risk AI systems, those systems
should be subject to a conformity assessment prior to their placing on the market or putting
into service.

(63) It is appropriate that, in order to minimise the burden on operators and avoid any possible
duplication, for high-risk AI systems related to products which are covered by existing
Union harmonisation legislation following the New Legislative Framework approach, the
compliance of those AI systems with the requirements of this Regulation should be
assessed as part of the conformity assessment already foreseen under that legislation. The
applicability of the requirements of this Regulation should thus not affect the specific
logic, methodology or general structure of conformity assessment under the relevant
specific New Legislative Framework legislation.

(64) Given the complexity of high-risk AI systems and the risks that are associated to them, it is
important to develop an adequate system of conformity assessment procedure for high risk
AI systems involving notified bodies, so called third party conformity assessment.

However, given the current experience of professional pre-market certifiers in the field of
product safety and the different nature of risks involved, it is appropriate to limit, at least in
an initial phase of application of this Regulation, the scope of application of third-party
conformity assessment for high-risk AI systems other than those related to products.

Therefore, the conformity assessment of such systems should be carried out as a general
rule by the provider under its own responsibility, with the only exception of AI systems
intended to be used for biometrics.

(65) In order to carry out third-party conformity assessments when so required, notified bodies
should be notified under this Regulation by the national competent authorities, provided 
they are compliant with a set of requirements, notably on independence, competence ,
absence of conflicts of interests and suitable cybersecurity requirements. Notification of
those bodies should be sent by national competent authorities to the Commission and the
other Member States by means of the electronic notification tool developed and managed
by the Commission pursuant to Article R23 of Decision 768/2008.

(65a) In line with Union commitments under the World Trade Organization Agreement on
Technical Barriers to Trade, it is adequate to facilitate the mutual recognition of
conformity assessment results produced by competent conformity assessment bodies,
independent of the territory in which they are established, provided that those conformity
assessment bodies established under the law of a third country meet the applicable
requirements of the Regulation and the Union has concluded an agreement to that extent.
In this context, the Commission should actively explore possible international instruments
for that purpose and in particular pursue the conclusion of mutual recognition agreements
with third countries.

(66) In line with the commonly established notion of substantial modification for products
regulated by Union harmonisation legislation, it is appropriate that whenever a change
occurs which may affect the compliance of a high risk AI system with this Regulation (e.g.
change of operating system or software architecture), or when the intended purpose of the
system changes, that AI system should be considered a new AI system which should
undergo a new conformity assessment. However, changes occuring to the algorithm and
the performance of AI systems which continue to ‘learn’ after being placed on the market
or put into service (i.e. automatically adapting how functions are carried out) should not
constitute a substantial modification, provided that those changes have been predetermined by the provider and assessed at the moment of the conformity assessment.

(67) High-risk AI systems should bear the CE marking to indicate their conformity with this
Regulation so that they can move freely within the internal market. For high-risk AI
systems embedded in a product, a physical CE marking should be affixed, and may be
complemented by a digital CE marking. For high-risk AI systems only provided digitally,
a digital CE marking should be used. Member States should not create unjustified obstacles
to the placing on the market or putting into service of high-risk AI systems that comply
with the requirements laid down in this Regulation and bear the CE marking.

(68) Under certain conditions, rapid availability of innovative technologies may be crucial for
health and safety of persons, the protection of the environment and climate change and for 
society as a whole. It is thus appropriate that under exceptional reasons of public security
or protection of life and health of natural persons, environmental protection and the
protection of key industrial and infrastructural assets , Market Surveillance Authorities
could authorise the placing on the market or putting into service of AI systems which have
not undergone a conformity assessment. In a duly justified situations as provided under this
regulations, law enforcement authorities or civil protection authorities may put a specific
high-risk AI system into service without the authorisation of the market surveillance
authority, provided that such authorisation is requested during or after the use without
undue delay.

(69) In order to facilitate the work of the Commission and the Member States in the artificial
intelligence field as well as to increase the transparency towards the public, providers of
high-risk AI systems other than those related to products falling within the scope of
relevant existing Union harmonisation legislation, as well as providers who consider that
an AI system referred to in annex III is by derogation not high-risk, should be required to
register themselves and information about their AI system in a EU database, to be
established and managed by the Commission. Before using a high-risk AI system listed in
Annex III, deployers of high-risk AI systems that are public authorities, agencies or
bodies, shall register themselves in such database and select the system that they envisage
to use.. Other deployers should be entitled to do so voluntarily. This section of the database
should be publicly accessible, free of charge, the information should be easily navigatable,
understandable and machine-readable. The database should also be user-friendly, for
example by providing search functionalities, including through keywords, allowing the
general public to find relevant information included in Annex VIII and on the areas of risk
under Annex III to which the high-risk AI systems correspond. . Any substantial
modification of high-risk AI systems should also be registered in the EU database. For
high risk AI systems in the area of law enforcement, migration, asylum and border control
management, the registration obligations should be fulfilled in a secure non-public section
of the database. Access to the secure non-public section should be strictly limited to the
Commission as well as to market surveillance authorities with regard to their national
section of that database. High risk AI systems in the area of critical infrastructure should
only be registered at national level. The Commission should be the controller of the EU
database, in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and 
of the Council26. In order to ensure the full functionality of the database, when deployed,
the procedure for setting the database should include the elaboration of functional
specifications by the Commission and an independent audit report. The Commission
should take into account cybersecurity and hazard-related risks when carrying out its tasks
as data controller on the EU database. In order to maximise the availability and use of the
database by the public, the database, including the information made available through it,
should comply with requirements under the Directive 2019/882.

(70) Certain AI systems intended to interact with natural persons or to generate content may
pose specific risks of impersonation or deception irrespective of whether they qualify as
high-risk or not. In certain circumstances, the use of these systems should therefore be
subject to specific transparency obligations without prejudice to the requirements and
obligations for high-risk AI systems and subject to targeted exceptions to take into account
the special need of law enforcement. In particular, natural persons should be notified that
they are interacting with an AI system, unless this is obvious from the point of view of a
natural person who is reasonably well-informed, observant and circumspect taking into
account the circumstances and the context of use. When implementing such obligation, the
characteristics of individuals belonging to vulnerable groups due to their age or disability
should be taken into account to the extent the AI system is intended to interact with those
groups as well. Moreover, natural persons should be notified when they are exposed to
systems that, by processing their biometric data, can identify or infer the emotions or
intentions of those persons or assign them to specific categories. Such specific categories
can relate to aspects such as sex, age, hair colour, eye colour, tattoos, personal traits, ethnic
origin, personal preferences and interests. Such information and notifications should be
provided in accessible formats for persons with disabilities.

(70a) A variety of AI systems can generate large quantities of synthetic content that becomes
increasingly hard for humans to distinguish from human-generated and authentic content.
The wide availability and increasing capabilities of those systems have a significant impact
on the integrity and trust in the information ecosystem, raising new risks of misinformation
and manipulation at scale, fraud, impersonation and consumer deception. In the light of
those impacts, the fast technological pace and the need for new methods and techniques to
trace origin of information, it is appropriate to require providers of those systems to embed
technical solutions that enable marking in a machine readable format and detection that the
output has been generated or manipulated by an AI system and not a human. Such
techniques and methods should be sufficiently reliable, interoperable, effective and robust
as far as this is technically feasible, taking into account available techniques or a
combination of such techniques, such as watermarks, metadata identifications,
cryptographic methods for proving provenance and authenticity of content, logging
methods, fingerprints or other techniques, as may be appropriate. When implementing this
obligation, providers should also take into account the specificities and the limitations of
the different types of content and the relevant technological and market developments in
the field, as reflected in the generally acknowledged state-of-the-art. Such techniques and
methods can be implemented at the level of the system or at the level of the model,
including general-purpose AI models generating content, thereby facilitating fulfilment of
this obligation by the downstream provider of the AI system. To remain proportionate, it is
appropriate to envisage that this marking obligation should not cover AI systems
performing primarily an assistive function for standard editing or AI systems not
substantially altering the input data provided by the deployer or the semantics thereof.

(70b) Further to the technical solutions employed by the providers of the system, deployers , who
use an AI system to generate or manipulate image, audio or video content that appreciably
resembles existing persons, places or events and would falsely appear to a person to be
authentic (‘deep fakes’), should also clearly and distinguishably disclose that the content
has been artificially created or manipulated by labelling the artificial intelligence output
accordingly and disclosing its artificial origin The compliance with this transparency
obligation should not be interpreted as indicating that the use of the system or its output
impedes the right to freedom of expression and the right to freedom of the arts and sciences
guaranteed in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, in particular where the content
is part of an evidently creative, satirical, artistic or fictional work or programme, subject to
appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of third parties. In those cases, the
transparency obligation for deep fakes set out in this Regulation is limited to disclosure of
the existence of such generated or manipulated content in an appropriate manner that does
not hamper the display or enjoyment of the work, including its normal exploitation and
use, while maintaining the utility and quality of the work. In addition, it is also appropriate
to envisage a similar disclosure obligation in relation to AI-generated or manipulated text
to the extent it is published with the purpose of informing the public on matters of public 
interest unless the AI-generated content has undergone a process of human review or
editorial control and a natural or legal person holds editorial responsibility for the
publication of the content.

(70c) To ensure consistent implementation, it is appropriate to empower the Commission to
adopt implementing acts on the application of the provisions on the labelling and detection
of artificially generated or manipulated content. Without prejudice to the mandatory nature
and full applicability of these obligations, the Commission may also encourage and
facilitate the drawing up of codes of practice at Union level to facilitate the effective
implementation of the obligations regarding the detection and labelling of artificially
generated or manipulated content, including to support practical arrangements for making,
as appropriate, the detection mechanisms accessible and facilitating cooperation with other
actors in the value chain, disseminating content or checking its authenticity and
provenance to enable the public to effectively distinguish AI-generated content.

(70d) The obligations placed on providers and deployers of certain AI systems in this Regulation
to enable the detection and disclosure that the outputs of those systems are artificially
generated or manipulated are particularly relevant to facilitate the effective implementation
of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065. This applies in particular as regards the obligations of
providers of very large online platforms or very large online search engines to identify and
mitigate systemic risks that may arise from the dissemination of content that has been
artificially generated or manipulated, in particular risk of the actual or foreseeable negative
effects on democratic processes, civic discourse and electoral processes, including through
disinformation. The requirement to label content generated by AI systems under this
Regulation is without prejudice to the obligation in Article 16(6) of Regulation 2022/2065
for providers of hosting services to process notices on illegal content received pursuant to
Article 16(1) and should not influence the assessment and the decision on the illegality of
the specific content. That assessment should be performed solely with reference to the
rules governing the legality of the content.

(70e) The compliance with the transparency obligations for the AI systems coved by this
Regulation should not be interpreted as indicating that the use of the system or its output is
lawful under this Regulation or other Union and Member State law and should be without
prejudice to other transparency obligations for deployers of AI systems laid down in Union
or national law.

(71) Artificial intelligence is a rapidly developing family of technologies that requires
regulatory oversight and a safe and controlled space for experimentation, while ensuring
responsible innovation and integration of appropriate safeguards and risk mitigation
measures. To ensure a legal framework that promotes innovation, is future-proof and
resilient to disruption, Member States should ensure that their national competent
authorities establish at least one artificial intelligence regulatory sandboxes at national
level to facilitate the development and testing of innovative AI systems under strict
regulatory oversight before these systems are placed on the market or otherwise put into
service. Member States could also fulfill this obligation through participating in already
existing regulatory sandboxes or establishing jointly a sandbox with one or several
Member States’ competent authorities, insofar as this participation provides equivalent
level of national coverage for the participating Member States. Regulatory sandboxes
could be established in physical, digital or hybrid form and may accommodate physical as
well as digital products. Establishing authorities should also ensure that the regulatory
sandboxes have the adequate resources for their functioning, including financial and
human resources.

(72) The objectives of the AI regulatory sandboxes should be to foster AI innovation by
establishing a controlled experimentation and testing environment in the development and
pre-marketing phase with a view to ensuring compliance of the innovative AI systems with
this Regulation and other relevant Union and Member States legislation, to enhance legal
certainty for innovators and the competent authorities’ oversight and understanding of the
opportunities, emerging risks and the impacts of AI use, to facilitate regulatory learning for
authorities and companies, including with a view to future adaptions of the legal
framework, to support cooperation and the sharing of best practices with the authorities
involved in the AI regulatory sandbox, and to accelerate access to markets, including by
removing barriers for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), including start-ups.
Regulatory sandboxes should be widely available throughout the Union, and particular
attention should be given to their accessibility for SMEs, including startups. The
participation in the AI regulatory sandbox should focus on issues that raise legal
uncertainty for providers and prospective providers to innovate, experiment with AI in the
Union and contribute to evidence-based regulatory learning. The supervision of the AI
systems in the AI regulatory sandbox should therefore cover their development, training,
testing and validation before the systems are placed on the market or put into service, as
well as the notion and occurrence of substantial modification that may require a new 
conformity assessment procedure. Any significant risks identified during the development
and testing of such AI systems should result in adequate mitigation and, failing that, in the
suspension of the development and testing process Where appropriate, national competent
authorities establishing AI regulatory sandboxes should cooperate with other relevant
authorities, including those supervising the protection of fundamental rights,, and could
allow for the involvement of other actors within the AI ecosystem such as national or
European standardisation organisations, notified bodies, testing and experimentation
facilities, research and experimentation labs, European Digital innovation hubs and
relevant stakeholder and civil society organisations. To ensure uniform implementation
across the Union and economies of scale, it is appropriate to establish common rules for
the regulatory sandboxes’ implementation and a framework for cooperation between the
relevant authorities involved in the supervision of the sandboxes. AI regulatory sandboxes
established under this Regulation should be without prejudice to other legislation allowing
for the establishment of other sandboxes aiming at ensuring compliance with legislation
other that this Regulation. Where appropriate, relevant competent authorities in charge of
those other regulatory sandboxes should consider the benefits of using those sandboxes
also for the purpose of ensuring compliance of AI systems with this Regulation. Upon
agreement between the national competent authorities and the participants in the AI
regulatory sandbox, testing in real world conditions may also be operated and supervised in
the framework of the AI regulatory sandbox.

(72a) This Regulation should provide the legal basis for the providers and prospective providers
in the AI regulatory sandbox to use personal data collected for other purposes for
developing certain AI systems in the public interest within the AI regulatory sandbox, only
under specified conditions, in line with Article 6(4) and 9(2)(g) of Regulation (EU)
2016/679, and Article 5, 6 and 10 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, and without prejudice to
Articles 4(2) and 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680. All other obligations of data controllers
and rights of data subjects under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, Regulation (EU) 2018/1725
and Directive (EU) 2016/680 remain applicable. In particular, this Regulation should not
provide a legal basis in the meaning of Article 22(2)(b) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and
Article 24(2)(b) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725. Providers and prospective providers in the
sandbox should ensure appropriate safeguards and cooperate with the competent
authorities, including by following their guidance and acting expeditiously and in good
faith to adequately mitigate any identified - significant risks to safety, health, and 
fundamental rights that may arise during the development, testing and experimentation in
the sandbox.

(72b) In order to accelerate the process of development and placing on the market of high-risk AI
systems listed in Annex III, it is important that providers or prospective providers of such
systems may also benefit from a specific regime for testing those systems in real world
conditions, without participating in an AI regulatory sandbox. However, in such cases and
taking into account the possible consequences of such testing on individuals, it should be
ensured that appropriate and sufficient guarantees and conditions are introduced by the
Regulation for providers or prospective providers. Such guarantees should include, among
others, requesting informed consent of natural persons to participate in testing in real world
conditions, with the exception of law enforcement in cases where the seeking of informed
consent would prevent the AI system from being tested. Consent of subjects to participate
in such testing under this Regulation is distinct from and without prejudice to consent of
data subjects for the processing of their personal data under the relevant data protection
law. It is also important to minimise the risks and enable oversight by competent
authorities and therefore require prospective providers to have a real-world testing plan
submitted to competent market surveillance authority, register the testing in dedicated
sections in the EU-wide database subject to some limited exceptions, set limitations on the
period for which the testing can be done and require additional safeguards for persons
belonging to certain vulnerable groups as well as a written agreement defining the roles
and responsibilities of prospective providers and deployers and effective oversight by
competent personnel involved in the real world testing. Furthermore, it is appropriate to
envisage additional safeguards to ensure that the predictions, recommendations or
decisions of the AI system can be effectively reversed and disregarded and that personal
data is protected and is deleted when the subjects have withdrawn their consent to
participate in the testing without prejudice to their rights as data subjects under the EU data
protection law. As regards transfer of data, it is also appropriate to envisage that data
collected and processed for the purpose of the testing in real world conditions should only
be transferred to third countries outside the Union provided appropriate and applicable
safeguards under Union law are implemented, notably in accordance with bases for
transfer of personal data under Union law on data protection, while for non-personal data
appropriate safeguards are put in place in accordance with Union law, such as the Data
Governance Act and the Data Act.

(72c) To ensure that Artificial Intelligence leads to socially and environmentally beneficial
outcomes, Member States are encouraged to support and promote research and
development of AI solutions in support of socially and environmentally beneficial
outcomes, such as AI-based solutions to increase accessibility for persons with disabilities,
tackle socio-economic inequalities, or meet environmental targets, by allocating sufficient
resources, including public and Union funding, and, where appropriate and provided that
the eligibility and selection criteria are fulfilled, considering in particular projects which
pursue such objectives. Such projects should be based on the principle of interdisciplinary
cooperation between AI developers, experts on inequality and non- discrimination,
accessibility, consumer, environmental, and digital rights, as well as academics.

(73) In order to promote and protect innovation, it is important that the interests of SMEs,
including start-ups, that are providers or deployers of AI systems are taken into particular
account. To this objective, Member States should develop initiatives, which are targeted at
those operators, including on , awareness raising and information communication. Member
States shall provide SME’s, including start-ups, having a registered office or a branch in
the Union, with priority access to the AI regulatory sandboxes provided that they fulfil the
eligibility conditions and selection criteria and without precluding other providers and
prospective providers to access the sandboxes provided the same conditions and criteria are
fulfilled. Member States shall utilise existing channels and where appropriate, establish
new dedicated channels for communication with SMEs, start-ups, deployers other
innovators and, as appropriate, local public authorities, to support SMEs throughout their
development path by providing guidance and responding to queries about the
implementation of this Regulation. Where appropriate, these channels shall work together
to create synergies and ensure homogeneity in their guidance to SMEs including start-ups
and deployers. Additionally, Member States should facilitate the participation of SMEs and
other relevant stakeholders in the standardisation development processes. Moreover, the
specific interests and needs of SMEs including start-up providers should be taken into
account when Notified Bodies set conformity assessment fees. The Commission should
regularly assess the certification and compliance costs for SMEs including start-ups,
through transparent consultations deployers and should work with Member States to lower
such costs. For example, translation costs related to mandatory documentation and
communication with authorities may constitute a significant cost for providers and other
operators, notably those of a smaller scale. Member States should possibly ensure that one
of the languages determined and accepted by them for relevant providers’ documentation 
and for communication with operators is one which is broadly understood by the largest
possible number of cross-border deployers. In order to address the specific needs of SMEs
including start-ups, the Commission should provide standardised templates for the areas
covered by this Regulation upon request of the AI Board. Additionally, the Commission
should complement Member States’ efforts by providing a single information platform
with easy-to-use information with regards to this Regulation for all providers and
deployers, by organising appropriate communication campaigns to raise awareness about
the obligations arising from this Regulation, and by evaluating and promoting the
convergence of best practices in public procurement procedures in relation to AI systems.
Medium-sized enterprises which recently changed from the small to medium-size category
within the meaning of the Annex to Recommendation 2003/361/EC (Article 16) should
have access to these support measures , as these new medium-sized enterprises may
sometimes lack the legal resources and training necessary to ensure proper understanding
and compliance with provisions.

(73a) In order to promote and protect innovation, the AI-on demand platform, all relevant EU
funding programmes and projects, such as Digital Europe Programme, Horizon Europe,
implemented by the Commission and the Member States at national or Union level should,
as appropriate, contribute to the achievement of the objectives of this Regulation.

(74) In particular, in order to minimise the risks to implementation resulting from lack of
knowledge and expertise in the market as well as to facilitate compliance of providers,
notably SMEs, including start-ups, and notified bodies with their obligations under this
Regulation, the AI-on demand platform, the European Digital Innovation Hubs and the
Testing and Experimentation Facilities established by the Commission and the Member
States at national or EU level should contribute to the implementation of this Regulation.
Within their respective mission and fields of competence, they may provide in particular
technical and scientific support to providers and notified bodies.

(74a) Moreover, in order to ensure proportionality considering the very small size of some
operators regarding costs of innovation, it is appropriate to allow microenterprises to
fulfill one of the most costly obligations, namely to establish a quality management
system, in a simplified manner which would reduce the administrative burden and the costs
for those enterprises without affecting the level of protection and the need for compliance
with the requirements for high-risk AI systems. The Commission should develop 
guidelines to specify the elements of the quality management system to be fulfilled in this
simplified manner by microentreprises.

(75) It is appropriate that the Commission facilitates, to the extent possible, access to Testing
and Experimentation Facilities to bodies, groups or laboratories established or accredited
pursuant to any relevant Union harmonisation legislation and which fulfil tasks in the
context of conformity assessment of products or devices covered by that Union
harmonisation legislation. This is notably the case for expert panels, expert laboratories
and reference laboratories in the field of medical devices pursuant to Regulation (EU)
2017/745 and Regulation (EU) 2017/746.

(75a) This Regulation should establish a governance framework that both allows to coordinate
and support the application of this Regulation at national level, as well as build capabilities
at Union level and integrate stakeholders in the field of artificial intelligence. The effective
implementation and enforcement of this Regulation require a governance framework that
allows to coordinate and build up central expertise at Union level. The Commission has
established the AI Office by Commission decision of […], which has as its mission to
develop Union expertise and capabilities in the field of artificial intelligence and to
contribute to the implementation of Union legislation on artificial intelligence. Member
States should facilitate the tasks of the AI Office with a view to support the development of
Union expertise and capabilities at Union level and to strengthen the functioning of the
digital single market. Furthermore, a European Artificial Intelligence Board composed of
representatives of the Member States, a scientific panel to integrate the scientific
community and an advisory forum to contribute stakeholder input to the implementation of
this Regulation, both at national and Union level, should be established. The development
of Union expertise and capabilities should also include making use of existing resources
and expertise, notably through synergies with structures built up in the context of the
Union level enforcement of other legislation and synergies with related initiatives at Union
level, such as the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking and the AI Testing and Experimentation
Facilities under the Digital Europe Programme.

(76) In order to facilitate a smooth, effective and harmonised implementation of this Regulation
a European Artificial Intelligence Board should be established. The Board should reflect
the various interests of the AI eco-system and be composed of representatives of the
Member States. The Board should be responsible for a number of advisory tasks, including
issuing opinions, recommendations, advice or contributing to guidance on matters related 
to the implementation of this Regulation, including on enforcement matters, technical
specifications or existing standards regarding the requirements established in this
Regulation and providing advice to the Commission and the Member States and their
national competent authorities on specific questions related to artificial intelligence. In
order to give some flexibility to Member States in the designation of their representatives
in the AI Board, such representatives may be any persons belonging to public entities who
should have the relevant competences and powers to facilitate coordination at national
level and contribute to the achievement of the Board's tasks. The Board should establish
two standing sub-groups to provide a platform for cooperation and exchange among
market surveillance authorities and notifying authorities on issues related respectively to
market surveillance and notified bodies. The standing subgroup for market surveillance
should act as the Administrative Cooperation Group (ADCO) for this Regulation in the
meaning of Article 30 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020. In line with the role and tasks of the
Commission pursuant to Article 33 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, the Commission should
support the activities of the standing subgroup for market surveillance by undertaking
market evaluations or studies, notably with a view to identifying aspects of this Regulation
requiring specific and urgent coordination among market surveillance authorities. The
Board may establish other standing or temporary sub-groups as appropriate for the purpose
of examining specific issues. The Board should also cooperate, as appropriate, with
relevant EU bodies, experts groups and networks active in the context of relevant EU
legislation, including in particular those active under relevant EU regulation on data,
digital products and services.

(76x) With a view to ensure the involvement of stakeholders in the implementation and
application of this Regulation, an advisory forum should be established to advise and
provide technical expertise to the Board and the Commission. To ensure a varied and
balanced stakeholder representation between commercial and non-commercial interest and,
within the category of commercial interests, with regards to SMEs and other undertakings,
the advisory forum should comprise inter alia industry, start-ups, SMEs, academia, civil
society, including social partners, as well as the Fundamental Rights Agency, European
Union Agency for Cybersecurity, the European Committee for Standardization (CEN), the
European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC) and the European
Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).

(76y) To support the implementation and enforcement of this Regulation, in particular the
monitoring activities of the AI Office as regards general-purpose AI models, a scientific
panel of independent experts should be established. The independent experts constituting 
the scientific panel should be selected on the basis of up-to-date scientific or technical
expertise in the field of artificial intelligence and should perform their tasks with
impartiality, objectivity and ensure the confidentiality of information and data obtained in
carrying out their tasks and activities. To allow reinforcing national capacities necessary
for the effective enforcement of this Regulation, Member States should be able to request
support from the pool of experts constituting the scientific panel for their enforcement
activities.

(76a) In order to support adequate enforcement as regards AI systems and reinforce the
capacities of the Member States, EU AI testing support structures should be established
and made available to the Member States.

(77) Member States hold a key role in the application and enforcement of this Regulation. In
this respect, each Member State should designate at least one notifying authority and at
least one market surveillance authority as national competent authorities for the purpose of
supervising the application and implementation of this Regulation. Member States may
decide to appoint any kind of public entity to perform the tasks of the national competent
authorities within the meaning of this Regulation, in accordance with their specific national
organisational characteristics and needs. In order to increase organisation efficiency on the
side of Member States and to set a single point of contact vis-à-vis the public and other
counterparts at Member State and Union levels, each Member State should designate a
market surveillance authority to act as single point of contact.

(77a) The national competent authorities should exercise their powers independently, impartially
and without bias, so as to safeguard the principles of objectivity of their activities and tasks
and to ensure the application and implementation of this Regulation. The members of these
authorities should refrain from any action incompatible with their duties and should be
subject to confidentiality rules under this Regulation.

(78) In order to ensure that providers of high-risk AI systems can take into account the
experience on the use of high-risk AI systems for improving their systems and the design
and development process or can take any possible corrective action in a timely manner, all
providers should have a post-market monitoring system in place. Where relevant, postmarket monitoring should include an analysis of the interaction with other AI systems
including other devices and software. Post-market monitoring should not cover sensitive
operational data of deployers which are law enforcement authorities. This system is also
key to ensure that the possible risks emerging from AI systems which continue to ‘learn’ 
after being placed on the market or put into service can be more efficiently and timely
addressed. In this context, providers should also be required to have a system in place to
report to the relevant authorities any serious incidents resulting from the use of their AI
systems, meaning incident or malfunctioning leading to death or serious damage to health,
serious and irreversible disruption of the management and operation of critical
infrastructure, breaches of obligations under Union law intended to protect fundamental
rights or serious damage to property or the environment.

(79) In order to ensure an appropriate and effective enforcement of the requirements and
obligations set out by this Regulation, which is Union harmonisation legislation, the
system of market surveillance and compliance of products established by Regulation (EU)
2019/1020 should apply in its entirety. Market surveillance authorities designated
pursuant to this Regulation should have all enforcement powers under this Regulation and
Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 and should exercise their powers and carry out their duties
independently, impartially and without bias. Although the majority of AI systems are not
subject to specific requirements and obligations under this Regulation, market surveillance
authorities may take measures in relation to all AI systems when they present a risk in
accordance with this Regulation. Due to the specific nature of Union institutions, agencies
and bodies falling within the scope of this Regulation, it is appropriate to designate the
European Data Protection Supervisor as a competent market surveillance authority for
them. This should be without prejudice to the designation of national competent authorities
by the Member States. Market surveillance activities should not affect the ability of the
supervised entities to carry out their tasks independently, when such independence is
required by Union law.

(79a) This Regulation is without prejudice to the competences, tasks, powers and independence
of relevant national public authorities or bodies which supervise the application of Union
law protecting fundamental rights, including equality bodies and data protection
authorities. Where necessary for their mandate, those national public authorities or bodies
should also have access to any documentation created under this Regulation. A specific
safeguard procedure should be set for ensuring adequate and timely enforcement against
AI systems presenting a risk to health, safety and fundamental rights. The procedure for
such AI systems presenting a risk should be applied to high-risk AI systems presenting a
risk, prohibited systems which have been placed on the market, put into service or used in
violation of the prohibited practices laid down in this Regulation and AI systems which 
have been made available in violation of the transparency requirements laid down in this
Regulation and present a risk.

(80) Union legislation on financial services includes internal governance and risk management
rules and requirements which are applicable to regulated financial institutions in the course
of provision of those services, including when they make use of AI systems. In order to
ensure coherent application and enforcement of the obligations under this Regulation and
relevant rules and requirements of the Union financial services legislation, the competent
authorities for the supervision and enforcement of the financial services legislation, notably
competent authorities as defined in Directive 2009/138/EC, Directive (EU) 2016/97,
Directive 2013/36/EU Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, Directive 2008/48/EC and Directive
2014/17/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, should be designated, within
their respective competences, as competent authorities for the purpose of supervising the
implementation of this Regulation, including for market surveillance activities, as regards
AI systems provided or used by regulated and supervised financial institutions unless
Member States decide to designate another authority to fulfil these market surveillance
tasks. Those competent authorities should have all powers under this Regulation and
Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 on market surveillance to enforce the requirements and
obligations of this Regulation, including powers to carry our ex post market surveillance
activities that can be integrated, as appropriate, into their existing supervisory mechanisms
and procedures under the relevant Union financial services legislation. It is appropriate to
envisage that, when acting as market surveillance authorities under this Regulation, the
national authorities responsible for the supervision of credit institutions regulated under
Directive 2013/36/EU, which are participating in the Single Supervisory Mechanism
(SSM) established by Council Regulation No 1024/2013, should report, without delay, to
the European Central Bank any information identified in the course of their market
surveillance activities that may be of potential interest for the European Central Bank’s
prudential supervisory tasks as specified in that Regulation. To further enhance the
consistency between this Regulation and the rules applicable to credit institutions regulated
under Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council27, it is also
appropriate to integrate some of the providers’ procedural obligations in relation to risk
management, post marketing monitoring and documentation into the existing obligations
and procedures under Directive 2013/36/EU. In order to avoid overlaps, limited
derogations should also be envisaged in relation to the quality management system of
providers and the monitoring obligation placed on deployers of high-risk AI systems to the
extent that these apply to credit institutions regulated by Directive 2013/36/EU. The same
regime should apply to insurance and re-insurance undertakings and insurance holding
companies under Directive 2009/138/EU (Solvency II) and the insurance intermediaries
under Directive 2016/97/EU and other types of financial institutions subject to
requirements regarding internal governance, arrangements or processes established
pursuant to the relevant Union financial services legislation to ensure consistency and
equal treatment in the financial sector.

(80-x) Each market surveillance authority for high-risk AI systems listed in point 1 of Annex III
insofar as these systems are used for law enforcement purposes and for purposes listed in
points 6, 7 and 8 of Annex III should have effective investigative and corrective powers,
including at least the power to obtain access to all personal data that are being processed
and to all information necessary for the performance of its tasks. The market surveillance
authorities should be able to exercise their powers by acting with complete independence.
Any limitations of their access to sensitive operational data under this Regulation should
be without prejudice to the powers conferred to them by Directive 2016/680. No exclusion
on disclosing data to national data protection authorities under this Regulation should
affect the current or future powers of those authorities beyond the scope of this Regulation.

(80x) The market surveillance authorities of the Member States and the Commission should be
able to propose joint activities, including joint investigations, to be conducted by market
surveillance authorities or market surveillance authorities jointly with the Commission,
that have the aim of promoting compliance, identifying non-compliance, raising awareness
and providing guidance in relation to this Regulation with respect to specific categories of
high-risk AI systems that are found to present a serious risk across several Member States.
Joint activities to promote compliance should be carried out in accordance with Article 9 of
the 2019/1020. The AI Office should provide coordination support for joint investigations.

(80y) It is necessary to clarify the responsibilities and competences on national and Union level
as regards AI systems that are built on general-purpose AI models. To avoid overlapping
competences, where an AI system is based on a general-purpose AI model and the model
and system are provided by the same provider, the supervision should take place at Union
level through the AI Office, which should have the powers of a market surveillance 
authority within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 for this purpose. In all other
cases, national market surveillance authorities remain responsible for the supervision of AI
systems. However, for general-purpose AI systems that can be used directly by deployers
for at least one purpose that is classified as high-risk, market surveillance authorities
should cooperate with the AI Office to carry out evaluations of compliance and inform the
Board and other market surveillance authorities accordingly. Furthermore, market
surveillance authorities should be able to request assistance from the AI Office where the
market surveillance authority is unable to conclude an investigation on a high-risk AI
system because of its inability to access certain information related to the general-purpose
AI model on which the high-risk AI system is built. In such cases, the procedure regarding
mutual assistance in cross-border cases in Chapter VI of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020
should apply by analogy.

(80z) To make best use of the centralised Union expertise and synergies at Union level, the
powers of supervision and enforcement of the obligations on providers of general-purpose
AI models should be a competence of the Commission. The Commission should entrust the
implementation of these tasks to the AI Office, without prejudice to the powers of
organisation of the Commission and the division of competences between member States
and the Union based on the Treaties. The AI Office should be able to carry out all
necessary actions to monitor the effective implementation of this Regulation as regards
general-purpose AI models. It should be able to investigate possible infringements of the
rules on providers of general-purpose AI models both on its own initiative, following the
results of its monitoring activities, or upon request from market surveillance authorities in
line with the conditions set out in this Regulation. To support effective monitoring of the
AI Office, it should provide for the possibility that downstream providers lodge complaints
about possible infringements of the rules on providers of general-purpose AI systems.

(80z+1) With a view to complement the governance systems for general-purpose AI
models, the scientific panel should support the monitoring activities of the AI Office and
may, in certain cases, provide qualified alerts to the AI Office which trigger follow-ups
such as investigations. This should be the case where the scientific panel has reason to
suspect that a general-purpose AI model poses a concrete and identifiable risk at Union
level. Furthermore, this should be the case where the scientific panel has reason to suspect
that a general-purpose AI model meets the criteria that would lead to a classification as
general-purpose AI model with systemic risk. To equip the scientific panel with the
information necessary for the performance of these tasks, there should be a mechanism 
whereby the scientific panel can request the Commission to require documentation or
information from a provider.

(80z+2) The AI Office should be able to take the necessary actions to monitor the effective
implementation of and compliance with the obligations for providers of general purpose AI
models laid down in this Regulation. The AI Office should be able to investigate possible
infringements in accordance with the powers provided for in this Regulation, including by
requesting documentation and information, by conducting evaluations, as well as by
requesting measures from providers of general purpose AI models. In the conduct of
evaluations, in order to make use of independent expertise, the AI Office should be able to
involve independent experts to carry out the evaluations on its behalf. Compliance with the
obligations should be enforceable, inter alia, through requests to take appropriate measures,
including risk mitigation measures in case of identified systemic risks as well as restricting
the making available on the market, withdrawing or recalling the model. As a safeguard in
case needed beyond the procedural rights provided for in this Regulation, providers of
general-purpose AI models should have the procedural rights provided for in Article 18 of
Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, which should apply by analogy, without prejudice to more
specific procedural rights provided for by this Regulation.

(81) The development of AI systems other than high-risk AI systems in accordance with the
requirements of this Regulation may lead to a larger uptake of ethical and trustworthy
artificial intelligence in the Union. Providers of non-high-risk AI systems should be
encouraged to create codes of conduct, including related governance mechanisms, intended
to foster the voluntary application of some or all of the mandatory requirements applicable
to high-risk AI systems, adapted in light of the intended purpose of the systems and the
lower risk involved and taking into account the available technical solutions and industry
best practices such as model and data cards. Providers and, as appropriate, deployers of all
AI systems, high-risk or not, and models should also be encouraged to apply on a
voluntary basis additional requirements related, for example, to the elements of the
European ethic guidelines for trustworthy AI, environmental sustainability, AI literacy
measures, inclusive and diverse design and development of AI systems, including attention
to vulnerable persons and accessibility to persons with disability, stakeholders’
participation with the involvement as appropriate, of relevant stakeholders such as business
and civil society organisations, academia and research organisations, trade unions and
consumer protection organisation in the design and development of AI systems, and
diversity of the development teams, including gender balance. To ensure that the voluntary 
codes of conduct are effective, they should be based on clear objectives and key
performance indicators to measure the achievement of those objectives. They should be
also developed in an inclusive way, as appropriate, with the involvement of relevant
stakeholders such as business and civil society organisations, academia and research
organisations, trade unions and consumer protection organisation. The Commission may
develop initiatives, including of a sectorial nature, to facilitate the lowering of technical
barriers hindering cross-border exchange of data for AI development, including on data
access infrastructure, semantic and technical interoperability of different types of data.

(82) It is important that AI systems related to products that are not high-risk in accordance with
this Regulation and thus are not required to comply with the requirements set out for highrisk AI systems are nevertheless safe when placed on the market or put into service. To
contribute to this objective, Regulation (EU) 2023/988 of the European Parliament and of
the Council28 would apply as a safety net.

(83) In order to ensure trustful and constructive cooperation of competent authorities on Union
and national level, all parties involved in the application of this Regulation should respect
the confidentiality of information and data obtained in carrying out their tasks, in
accordance with Union or national law. They should carry out their tasks and activities in
such a manner as to protect, in particular, intellectual property rights, confidential
business information and trade secrets, the effective implementation of this Regulation,
public and national security interests, the integrity of criminal or administrative
proceedings, and the integrity of classified information.

(84) Compliance with this Regulation should be enforceable by means of the imposition of
penalties and other enforcement measures. Member States should take all necessary
measures to ensure that the provisions of this Regulation are implemented, including by
laying down effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties for their infringement, and in
respect of the ne bis in idem principle. In order to strengthen and harmonise administrative
penalties for infringement of this Regulation, the upper limits for setting the administrative
fines for certain specific infringements should be laid down. When assessing the amount of
the fines, Member States should, in each individual case, take into account all relevant
circumstances of the specific situation, with due regard in particular to the nature, gravity
and duration of the infringement and of its consequences and to the provider’s size, in
particular if the provider is an SME including a start-up. The European Data Protection
Supervisor should have the power to impose fines on Union institutions, agencies and
bodies falling within the scope of this Regulation.

(84a) Compliance with the obligations on providers of general-purpose AI models imposed
under this Regulation should be enforceable among others by means of fines. To that end,
appropriate levels of fines should also be laid down for infringement of those obligations,
including the failure to comply with measures requested by the Commission in accordance
with this Regulation, subject to appropriate limitation periods in accordance with the
principle of proportionality. All decisions taken by the Commission under this Regulation
are subject to review by the Court of Justice of the European Union in accordance with the
TFEU.

(84aa) Union and national law already provides effective remedies to natural and legal persons
whose rights and freedoms are adversely affected by the use of AI systems. Without
prejudice to those remedies, any natural or legal person having grounds to consider that
there has been an infringement of the provisions of this Regulation should be entitled to
lodge a complaint to the relevant market surveillance authority.

(84b) Affected persons should have the right to request an explanation when a decision is taken
by the deployer with the output from certain high-risk systems as provided for in this
Regulation as the main basis and which produces legal effects or similarly significantly
affects him or her in a way that they consider to adversely impact their health, safety or
fundamental rights. This explanation should be a clear and meaningful and should provide
a basis for affected persons to exercise their rights. This should not apply to the use of AI
systems for which exceptions or restrictions follow from Union or national law and should
apply only to the extent this right is not already provided for under Union legislation.

(84c) Persons acting as ‘whisteblowers’ on the breaches of this Regulation should be afforded
the protection guaranteed by Union legislation on the protection of persons who report
breaches of law. Therefore, Directive (EU) 2019/1937 should apply to the reporting of
breaches of this Regulation and the protection of persons reporting such breaches.

(85) In order to ensure that the regulatory framework can be adapted where necessary, the
power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the
Commission to amend the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex II, the high-risk
AI systems listed in Annex III, the provisions regarding technical documentation listed in
Annex IV, the content of the EU declaration of conformity in Annex V, the provisions
regarding the conformity assessment procedures in Annex VI and VII, the provisions
establishing the high-risk AI systems to which the conformity assessment procedure based
on assessment of the quality management system and assessment of the technical
documentation should apply, the threshold as well as to supplement benchmarks and
indicators in the rules for classification of general-purpose AI models with systemic risk,
the criteria for the designation of general-purpose AI models with systemic risk in Annex
YY, the technical documentation for providers of general-purpose AI models in Annex
VIIIb and the transparency information for providers of general-purpose AI models in
Annex VIIIc. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate
consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those
consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the
Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making1
. In particular, to
ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament
and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and
their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing
with the preparation of delegated acts.

(85a) Given the rapid technological developments and the required technical expertise in the
effective application of this Regulation, the Commission should evaluate and review this
Regulation by three years after the date of entry into application and every four years
thereafter and report to the European Parliament and the Council. In addition, taking into
account the implications for the scope of this Regulation, the Commission should carry out
an assessment of the need to amend the list in Annex III and the list of prohibited practices
once a year. Moreover, by two years after entry into application and every four years
thereafter, the Commission should evaluate and report to the European Parliament and to
the Council on the need to amend the high-risk areas in Annex III, the AI systems within
the scope of the transparency obligations in Title IV, the effectiveness of the supervision
and governance system and the progress on the development of standardisation
deliverables on energy efficient development of general-purpose AI models, including the
need for further measures or actions. Finally, within two years after the entry into 
application and every three years thereafter, the Commission should evaluate the impact
and effectiveness of voluntary codes of conducts to foster the application of the
requirements set out in Title III, Chapter 2, for systems other than high-risk AI systems and
possibly other additional requirements for such AI systems.

(86) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation,
implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be
exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament
and of the Council1
.

(87) Since the objective of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member
States and can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at
Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of
subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 TEU. In accordance with the principle of proportionality
as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to
achieve that objective.

(87a) In order to ensure legal certainty, ensure an appropriate adaptation period for operators and
avoid disruption to the market, including by ensuring continuity of the use of AI systems, it
is appropriate that this Regulation applies to the high-risk AI systems that have been placed
on the market or put into service before the general date of application thereof, only if,
from that date, those systems are subject to significant changes in their design or intended
purpose. It is appropriate to clarify that, in this respect, the concept of significant change
should be understood as equivalent in substance to the notion of substantial modification,
which is used with regard only to high-risk AI systems as defined in this Regulation. By
way of exception and in light of public accountability, operators of AI systems which are
components of the large-scale IT systems established by the legal acts listed in Annex IX
and operators of high-risk AI systems that are intended to be used by public authorities
should take the necessary steps to comply with the requirements of this Regulation by end
of 2030 and by four years after the entry into application respectively.

(87b) Providers of high-risk AI systems are encouraged to start to comply, on voluntary basis,
with the relevant obligations foreseen under this Regulation already during the transitional
period.

(88) This Regulation should apply from … [OP – please insert the date established in Art. 85].
However, taking into account the unacceptable risk associated with the use of AI in certain 
ways, the prohibitions should apply already from … [OP – please insert the date – 6
months after entry into force of this Regulation]. While the full effect of these prohibitions
follows with the establishment of the governance and enforcement of this Regulation,
anticipating the application of the prohibitions is important to take account of unacceptable
risk and has effect on other procedures, such as in civil law. Moreover, the infrastructure
related to the governance and the conformity assessment system should be operational
before that date, therefore the provisions on notified bodies and governance structure
should apply from … [OP – please insert the date – twelve months following the entry into
force of this Regulation]. Given the rapid pace of technological advancements and
adoption of general-purpose AI models, obligations for providers of general purpose AI
models should apply within 12 months from the date of entry into force. Codes of Practice
should be ready at the latest 3 months before the entry into application of the relevant
provisions, to enable providers to demonstrate compliance in time. The AI Office should
ensure that classification rules and procedures are up to date in light of technological
developments. In addition, Member States should lay down and notify to the Commission
the rules on penalties, including administrative fines, and ensure that they are properly and
effectively implemented by the date of application of this Regulation. Therefore, the
provisions on penalties should apply from [OP – please insert the date – twelve months
following the entry into force of this Regulation].

(89) The European Data Protection Supervisor and the European Data Protection Board were
consulted in accordance with Article 42(2) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and delivered an
opinion on ”18 June 2021.

TITLE II

PROHIBITED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PRACTICES

Article 5

Prohibited Artificial Intelligence Practices

1. The following artificial intelligence practices shall be prohibited:

(a) the placing on the market, putting into service or use of an AI system that deploys
subliminal techniques beyond a person’s consciousness or purposefully manipulative
or deceptive techniques, with the objective to or the effect of materially distorting a
person’s or a group of persons’ behaviour by appreciably impairing the person’s
ability to make an informed decision, thereby causing the person to take a decision
that that person would not have otherwise taken in a manner that causes or is likely
to cause that person, another person or group of persons significant harm;

(b) the placing on the market, putting into service or use of an AI system that exploits
any of the vulnerabilities of a person or a specific group of persons due to their age,
disability or a specific social or economic situation, with the objective to or the effect
of materially distorting the behaviour of that person or a person pertaining to that
group in a manner that causes or is reasonably likely to cause that person or another
person significant harm

(ba) the placing on the market or putting into service for this specific purpose, or use of
biometric categorisation systems that categorise individually natural persons based
on their biometric data to deduce or infer their race, political opinions, trade union 
membership, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life or sexual orientation.
This prohibition does not cover any labelling or filtering of lawfully acquired
biometric datasets, such as images, based on biometric data or categorizing of
biometric data in the area of law enforcement.

(c) the placing on the market, putting into service or use of AI systems for the
evaluation or classification of natural persons or groups thereof over a certain period
of time based on their social behaviour or known, inferred or predicted personal or
personality characteristics, with the social score leading to either or both of the
following:

(i) detrimental or unfavourable treatment of certain natural persons or whole
groups thereof in social contexts that are unrelated to the contexts in which the
data was originally generated or collected;

(ii) detrimental or unfavourable treatment of certain natural persons or groups
thereof that is unjustified or disproportionate to their social behaviour or its
gravity;

(d) the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible
spaces for the purpose of law enforcement unless and in as far as such use is strictly
necessary for one of the following objectives:

(i) the targeted search for specific victims of abduction, trafficking in human
beings and sexual exploitation of human beings as well as search for missing
persons

(ii) the prevention of a specific, substantial and imminent threat to the life or
physical safety of natural persons or a genuine and present or genuine and
foreseeable threat of a terrorist attack

(iii) the localisation or identification of a person suspected of having committed a
criminal offence, for the purposes of conducting a criminal investigation,
prosecution or executing a criminal penalty for offences, referred to in Annex
IIa and punishable in the Member State concerned by a custodial sentence or a
detention order for a maximum period of at least four years.

This paragraph is without prejudice to the provisions in Article 9 of the GDPR
for the processing of biometric data for purposes other than law enforcement.

(da) the placing on the market, putting into service for this specific purpose, or
use of an AI system for making risk assessments of natural persons in order to
assess or predict the risk of a natural person to commit a criminal offence,
based solely on the profiling of a natural person or on assessing their
personality traits and characteristics;

This prohibition shall not apply to AI systems used to support the human
assessment of the involvement of a person in a criminal activity, which is
already based on objective and verifiable facts directly linked to a criminal
activity.

(db) the placing on the market, putting into service for this specific purpose, or use
of AI systems that create or expand facial recognition databases through the
untargeted scraping of facial images from the internet or CCTV footage;
dc) the placing on the market, putting into service for this specific purpose, or use
of AI systems to infer emotions of a natural person in the areas of workplace
and education institutions except in cases where the use of the AI system is
intended to be put in place or into the market for medical or safety reasons;

(b) the product whose safety component pursuant to point (a) is the AI system, or the AI
system itself as a product, is required to undergo a third-party conformity
assessment, with a view to the placing on the market or putting into service of that
product pursuant to the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex II;

2. In addition to the high-risk AI systems referred to in paragraph 1, AI systems referred to in
Annex III shall also be considered high-risk.

2a. By derogation from paragraph 2 AI systems shall not be considered as high risk if they do
not pose a significant risk of harm, to the health, safety or fundamental rights of natural
persons, including by not materially influencing the outcome of decision making. This
shall be the case if one or more of the following criteria are fulfilled:

(a) the AI system is intended to perform a narrow procedural task;

(b) the AI system is intended to improve the result of a previously completed human
activity;

(c) the AI system is intended to detect decision-making patterns or deviations from prior
decision-making patterns and is not meant to replace or influence the previously
completed human assessment, without proper human review; or

(d) the AI system is intended to perform a preparatory task to an assessment relevant for
the purpose of the use cases listed in Annex III.

Notwithstanding first subparagraph of this paragraph, an AI system shall always be
considered high-risk if the AI system performs profiling of natural persons.

2b. A provider who considers that an AI system referred to in Annex III is not high-risk shall
document its assessment before that system is placed on the market or put into service.
Such provider shall be subject to the registration obligation set out in Article 51(1a). Upon
request of national competent authorities, the provider shall provide the documentation of
the assessment.

2c. The Commission shall, after consulting the AI Board, and no later than [18 months] after
the entry into force of this Regulation, provide guidelines specifying the practical
implementation of this article completed by a comprehensive list of practical examples of
high risk and non-high risk use cases on AI systems pursuant to Article 82b.

2d. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 73 to
amend the criteria laid down in points a) to d) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 2a.
The Commission may adopt delegated acts adding new criteria to those laid down in points
a) to d) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 2a, or modifying them, only where there is
concrete and reliable evidence of the existence of AI systems that fall under the scope of

Annex III, the Commission shall take into account the following criteria:

(a) the intended purpose of the AI system;

(b) the extent to which an AI system has been used or is likely to be used;

(ba) the nature and amount of the data processed and used by the AI system, in particular
whether special categories of personal data are processed;

(bb) the extent to which the AI system acts autonomously and the possibility for a human
to override a decision or recommendations that may lead to potential harm;

(c) the extent to which the use of an AI system has already caused harm to health and
safety, has had an adverse impact on fundamental rights or has given rise to
significant concerns in relation to the likelihood of such harm or adverse impact, as
demonstrated for example by reports or documented allegations submitted to national
competent authorities or by other reports, as appropriate.

(d) the potential extent of such harm or such adverse impact, in particular in terms of its
intensity and its ability to affect a plurality of persons or to disproportionately affect
a particular group of persons;

(e) the extent to which potentially harmed or adversely impacted persons are dependent
on the outcome produced with an AI system, in particular because for practical or
legal reasons it is not reasonably possible to opt-out from that outcome;

(f) the extent to which there is an imbalance of power, or the potentially harmed or
adversely impacted persons are in a vulnerable position in relation to the user of an
AI system, in particular due to status, authority, knowledge, economic or social
circumstances, or age;

(g) the extent to which the outcome produced involving an AI system is easily corrigible
or reversible, taking into account the technical solutions available to correct or
reverse, whereby outcomes having and adverse impact on health, safety, fundamental
rights, shall not be considered as easily corrigible or reversible.

(gb) the magnitude and likelihood of benefit of the deployment of the AI system for
individuals, groups, or society at large, including possible improvements in product
safety;

in relation to high-risk AI systems.

2. The risk management system shall be understood as a continuous iterative process planned
and run throughout the entire lifecycle of a high-risk AI system, requiring regular
systematic review and updating. It shall comprise the following steps:

(a) identification and analysis of the known and the reasonably foreseeable risks that the
high-risk AI system can pose to the health, safety or fundamental rights when the
high-risk AI system is used in accordance with its intended purpose ;

(b) estimation and evaluation of the risks that may emerge when the high-risk AI system
is used in accordance with its intended purpose and under conditions of reasonably
foreseeable misuse;

(c) evaluation of other possibly arising risks based on the analysis of data gathered from
the post-market monitoring system referred to in Article 61;

(d) adoption of appropriate and targeted risk management measures designed to address
the risks identified pursuant to point a of this paragraph in accordance with the
provisions of the following paragraphs.

2a. The risks referred to in this paragraph shall concern only those which may be reasonably
mitigated or eliminated through the development or design of the high-risk AI system, or
the provision of adequate technical information.

3. The risk management measures referred to in paragraph 2, point (d) shall give due
consideration to the effects and possible interaction resulting from the combined
application of the requirements set out in this Chapter 2, with a view to minimising risks
more effectively while achieving an appropriate balance in implementing the measures to
fulfil those requirements.

4. The risk management measures referred to in paragraph 2, point (d) shall be such that
relevant residual risk associated with each hazard as well as the overall residual risk of the
high-risk AI systems is judged to be acceptable.

In identifying the most appropriate risk management measures, the following shall be
ensured:

(a) elimination or reduction of identified risks and evaluated pursuant to paragraph 2 as
far as technically feasible through adequate design and development of the high-risk
AI system, 

(b) where appropriate, implementation of adequate mitigation and control measures
addressing risks that cannot be eliminated;

(c) provision of the required information pursuant to Article 13, referred to in paragraph

2, point (b) of this Article, and, where appropriate, training to deployers.
With a view to eliminating or reducing risks related to the use of the high-risk AI system,
due consideration shall be given to the technical knowledge, experience, education,
training to be expected by the deployer and the presumable context in which the system is
intended to be used.

5. High-risk AI systems shall be tested for the purposes of identifying the most appropriate
and targeted risk management measures. Testing shall ensure that high-risk AI systems
perform consistently for their intended purpose and they are in compliance with the
requirements set out in this Chapter.

Article 10

Data and data governance

1. High-risk AI systems which make use of techniques involving the training of models with
data shall be developed on the basis of training, validation and testing data sets that meet
the quality criteria referred to in paragraphs 2 to 5 whenever such datasets are used.

2. Training, validation and testing data sets shall be subject to appropriate data governance
and management practices appropriate for the intended purpose of the AI system. Those
practices shall concern in particular,

(a) the relevant design choices;

(aa) data collection processes and origin of data, and in the case of personal data, the
original purpose of data collection;

(b) [deleted]

(c) relevant data preparation processing operations, such as annotation, labelling,
cleaning, updating, enrichment and aggregation;

(d) the formulation of assumptions, notably with respect to the information that the data
are supposed to measure and represent;

(e) an assessment of the availability, quantity and suitability of the data sets that are
needed;

(f) examination in view of possible biases that are likely to affect the health and safety
of persons, negatively impact fundamental rights or lead to discrimination prohibited
under Union law, especially where data outputs influence inputs for future
operations;

(fa) appropriate measures to detect, prevent and mitigate possible biases identified
according to point f;

(g) the identification of relevant data gaps or shortcomings that prevent compliance with
this Regulation, and how those gaps and shortcomings can be addressed.

3. Training, validation and testing datasets shall be relevant, sufficiently representative, and
to the best extent possible, free of errors and complete in view of the intended purpose.
They shall have the appropriate statistical properties, including, where applicable, as
regards the persons or groups of persons in relation to whom the high-risk AI system is
intended to be used. These characteristics of the data sets may be met at the level of
individual data sets or a combination thereof.

4. Datasets shall take into account, to the extent required by the intended purpose, the
characteristics or elements that are particular to the specific geographical, contextual,
behavioural or functional setting within which the high-risk AI system is intended to be
used.

5. To the extent that it is strictly necessary for the purposes of ensuring bias detection and
correction in relation to the high-risk AI systems in accordance with the second paragraph,
point f and fa, the providers of such systems may exceptionally process special categories
of personal data referred to in Article 9(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, Article 10 of
Directive (EU) 2016/680 and Article 10(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, subject to
appropriate safeguards for the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons. In
addition to provisions set out in the Regulation (EU) 2016/679, Directive (EU) 2016/680
and Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, all the following conditions shall apply in order for such
processing to occur:

(a) the bias detection and correction cannot be effectively fulfilled by processing other
data, including synthetic or anonymised data;

(b) the special categories of personal data processed for the purpose of this paragraph are
subject to technical limitations on the re-use of the personal data and state of the art
security and privacy-preserving measures, including pseudonymisation;

(c) the special categories of personal data processed for the purpose of this paragraph are
subject to measures to ensure that the personal data processed are secured, protected,
subject to suitable safeguards, including strict controls and documentation of the
access, to avoid misuse and ensure only authorised persons have access to those
personal data with appropriate confidentiality obligations;

(d) the special categories of personal data processed for the purpose of this paragraph are
not to be transmitted, transferred or otherwise accessed by other parties;

(e) the special categories of personal data processed for the purpose of this paragraph are
deleted once the bias has been corrected or the personal data has reached the end of
its retention period, whatever comes first;

(f) the records of processing activities pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2016/679, Directive
(EU) 2016/680 and Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 includes justification why the
processing of special categories of personal data was strictly necessary to detect and
correct biases and this objective could not be achieved by processing other data.

6. For the development of high-risk AI systems not using techniques involving the training of
models, paragraphs 2 to 5 shall apply only to the testing data sets.

Article 11

Technical documentation

1. The technical documentation of a high-risk AI system shall be drawn up before that system
is placed on the market or put into service and shall be kept up-to date.

The technical documentation shall be drawn up in such a way to demonstrate that the highrisk AI system complies with the requirements set out in this Chapter and provide national
competent authorities and notified bodies with the necessary information in a clear and
comprehensive form to assess the compliance of the AI system with those requirements. It
shall contain, at a minimum, the elements set out in Annex IV. SMEs, including start-ups,
may provide the elements of the technical documentation specified in Annex IV in a
simplified manner. For this purpose, the Commission shall establish a simplified technical
documentation form targeted at the needs of small and micro enterprises. Where an SME,
including start-ups, opts to provide the information required in Annex IV in a simplified
manner, it shall use the form referred to in this paragraph. Notified bodies shall accept the
form for the purpose of conformity assessment.

2. Where a high-risk AI system related to a product, to which the legal acts listed in Annex II,
section A apply, is placed on the market or put into service one single technical
documentation shall be drawn up containing all the information set out in paragraph 1 as
well as the information required under those legal acts.

3. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 73 to
amend Annex IV where necessary to ensure that, in the light of technical progress, the 
technical documentation provides all the necessary information to assess the compliance of
the system with the requirements set out in this Chapter.

Article 12

Record-keeping

1. High-risk AI systems shall technically allow for the automatic recording of events (‘logs’)
over the duration of the lifetime of the system.

2. In order to ensure a level of traceability of the AI system’s functioning that is appropriate
to the intended purpose of the system, logging capabilities shall enable the recording of
events relevant for:

2a. (i) identification of situations that may result in the AI system presenting a risk within the
meaning of Article 65(1) or in a substantial modification; (ii) facilitation of the post-market
monitoring referred to in Article 61; and (iii) monitoring of the operation of high-risk AI

Article 14

Human oversight

1. High-risk AI systems shall be designed and developed in such a way, including with
appropriate human-machine interface tools, that they can be effectively overseen by natural
persons during the period in which the AI system is in use.

2. Human oversight shall aim at preventing or minimising the risks to health, safety or
fundamental rights that may emerge when a high-risk AI system is used in accordance with
its intended purpose or under conditions of reasonably foreseeable misuse, in particular
when such risks persist notwithstanding the application of other requirements set out in this
Chapter.

3. The oversight measures shall be commensurate to the risks, level of autonomy and context
of use of the AI system and shall be ensured through either one or all of the following
types of measures:

(a) measures identified and built, when technically feasible, into the high-risk AI system
by the provider before it is placed on the market or put into service;

(b) measures identified by the provider before placing the high-risk AI system on the
market or putting it into service and that are appropriate to be implemented by the
user.

4. For the purpose of implementing paragraphs 1 to 3, the high-risk AI system shall be
provided to the user in such a way that natural persons to whom human oversight is
assigned are enabled, as appropriate and proportionate to the circumstances:

(a) to properly understand the relevant capacities and limitations of the high-risk AI
system and be able to duly monitor its operation, also in view of detecting and
addressing anomalies, dysfunctions and unexpected performance;

(b) to remain aware of the possible tendency of automatically relying or over-relying on
the output produced by a high-risk AI system (‘automation bias’), in particular for
high-risk AI systems used to provide information or recommendations for decisions
to be taken by natural persons;

(c) to correctly interpret the high-risk AI system’s output, taking into account for
example the interpretation tools and methods available;

(d) to decide, in any particular situation, not to use the high-risk AI system or otherwise
disregard, override or reverse the output of the high-risk AI system;

(e) to intervene on the operation of the high-risk AI system or interrupt, the system
through a "stop" button or a similar procedure that allows the system to come to a
halt in a safe state.

5. For high-risk AI systems referred to in point 1(a) of Annex III, the measures referred to in
paragraph 3 shall be such as to ensure that, in addition, no action or decision is taken by the
deployer on the basis of the identification resulting from the system unless this has been
separately verified and confirmed by at least two natural persons with the necessary
competence, training and authority.

The requirement for a separate verification by at least two natural persons shall not apply
to high risk AI systems used for the purpose of law enforcement, migration, border control 
or asylum, in cases where Union or national law considers the application of this
requirement to be disproportionate.

Article 15

Accuracy, robustness and cybersecurity

1. High-risk AI systems shall be designed and developed in such a way that they achieve an
appropriate level of accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity, and perform consistently in
those respects throughout their lifecycle.

1a. To address the technical aspects of how to measure the appropriate levels of accuracy and
robustness set out in paragraph 1 of this Article and any other relevant performance
metrics, the Commission shall, in cooperation with relevant stakeholder and organisations
such as metrology and benchmarking authorities, encourage as appropriate, the
development of benchmarks and measurement methodologies.

2. The levels of accuracy and the relevant accuracy metrics of high-risk AI systems shall be
declared in the accompanying instructions of use.

3. High-risk AI systems shall be as resilient as possible regarding errors, faults or
inconsistencies that may occur within the system or the environment in which the system
operates, in particular due to their interaction with natural persons or other systems.
Technical and organisational measures shall be taken towards this regard.

The robustness of high-risk AI systems may be achieved through technical redundancy
solutions, which may include backup or fail-safe plans.

High-risk AI systems that continue to learn after being placed on the market or put into
service shall be developed in such a way to eliminate or reduce as far as possible the risk of
possibly biased outputs influencing input for future operations (‘feedback loops’) are duly
addressed with appropriate mitigation measures.

4. High-risk AI systems shall be resilient as regards to attempts by unauthorised third parties
to alter their use, outputs or performance by exploiting the system vulnerabilities.

The technical solutions aimed at ensuring the cybersecurity of high-risk AI systems shall
be appropriate to the relevant circumstances and the risks.

The technical solutions to address AI specific vulnerabilities shall include, where
appropriate, measures to prevent, detect, respond to, resolve and control for attacks trying
to manipulate the training dataset (‘data poisoning’), or pre-trained components used in
training (‘model poisoning’) , inputs designed to cause the model to make a mistake
(‘adversarial examples’ or ‘model evasion’), confidentiality attacks or model flaws.

Article 29

Obligations of deployers of high-risk AI systems

1. Deployers of high-risk AI systems shall take appropriate technical and organisational
measures to ensure they use such systems in accordance with the instructions of use
accompanying the systems, pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 5 of this Article.

1a. Deployers shall assign human oversight to natural persons who have the necessary
competence, training and authority, as well as the necessary support.

1a. To the extent deployers exercise control over the high-risk AI system, they shall ensure
that the natural persons assigned to ensure human oversight of the high-risk AI systems
have the necessary competence, training and authority as well as the necessary support

2. The obligations in paragraph 1 and 1a, are without prejudice to other deployer obligations
under Union or national law and to the deployer’s discretion in organising its own
resources and activities for the purpose of implementing the human oversight measures
indicated by the provider.

3. Without prejudice to paragraph 1 and 1a, to the extent the deployer exercises control over
the input data, that deployer shall ensure that input data is relevant and sufficiently
representative in view of the intended purpose of the high-risk AI system.

4. 4. Deployers shall monitor the operation of the high-risk AI system on the basis of the
instructions of use and when relevant, inform providers in accordance with Article 61.
When they have reasons to consider that the use in accordance with the instructions of use
may result in the AI system presenting a risk within the meaning of Article 65(1) they
shall, without undue delay, inform the provider or distributor and relevant market
surveillance authority and suspend the use of the system. They shall also immediately
inform first the provider, and then the importer or distributor and relevant market
surveillance authorities when they have identified any serious incident If the deployer is
not able to reach the provider, Article 62 shall apply mutatis mutandis. This obligation
shall not cover sensitive operational data of users of AI systems which are law enforcement
authorities.

For deployers that are financial institutions subject to requirements regarding their internal
governance, arrangements or processes under Union financial services legislation, the
monitoring obligation set out in the first subparagraph shall be deemed to be fulfilled by
complying with the rules on internal governance arrangements, processes and mechanisms
pursuant to the relevant financial service legislation.

5. Deployers of high-risk AI systems shall keep the logs automatically generated by that
high-risk AI system to the extent such logs are under their control for a period appropriate
to the intended purpose of the high-risk AI system, of at least six months, unless provided
otherwise in applicable Union or national law, in particular in Union law on the protection
of personal data.

Deployers that are financial institutions subject to requirements regarding their internal
governance, arrangements or processes under Union financial services legislation shall
maintain the logs as part of the documentation kept pursuant to the relevant Union
financial service legislation.

(a) Prior to putting into service or use a high-risk AI system at the workplace, deployers
who are employers shall inform workers representatives and the affected workers
that they will be subject to the system. This information shall be provided, where 
applicable, in accordance with the rules and procedures laid down in Union and
national law and practice on information of workers and their representatives.

(b) Deployers of high-risk AI systems that are public authorities or Union institutions,
bodies, offices and agencies shall comply with the registration obligations referred to

the deployer of an AI system for post-remote biometric identification shall request an
authorisation, prior, or without undue delay and no later than 48hours, by a judicial
authority or an administrative authority whose decision is binding and subject to judicial
review, for the use of the system, except when the system is used for the initial
identification of a potential suspect based on objective and verifiable facts directly linked
to the offence. Each use shall be limited to what is strictly necessary for the investigation
of a specific criminal offence.

If the requested authorisation provided for in the first subparagraph of this paragraph is
rejected, the use of the post remote biometric identification system linked to that
authorisation shall be stopped with immediate effect and the personal data linked to the use
of the system for which the authorisation was requested shall be deleted.

In any case, such AI system for post remote biometric identification shall not be used for
law enforcement purposes in an untargeted way, without any link to a criminal offence, a
criminal proceeding, a genuine and present or genuine and foreseeable threat of a criminal
offence or the search for a specific missing person.

It shall be ensured that no decision that produces an adverse legal effect on a person may
be taken by the law enforcement authorities solely based on the output of these post remote 
biometric identification systems.

This paragraph is without prejudice to the provisions of Article 10 of the Directive (EU)
2016/680 and Article 9 of the GDPR for the processing of biometric data.

Regardless of the purpose or deployer, each use of these systems shall be documented in
the relevant police file and shall be made available to the relevant market surveillance
authority and the national data protection authority upon request, excluding the disclosure
of sensitive operational data related to law enforcement. This subparagraph shall be

ensure the conformity of AI systems on the market;

(d) inform the Commission and the Member States about certificates of which it has
required their suspension or withdrawal;

(e) provide the national competent authorities of the Member State in which the provider
has its registered place of business with all relevant information about the certificates
for which it has required suspension or withdrawal. That competent authority shall
take the appropriate measures, where necessary, to avoid a potential risk to health,
safety or fundamental rights.

2d. With the exception of certificates unduly issued, and where a notification has been
suspended or restricted, the certificates shall remain valid in the following circumstances:

(a) the notifying authority has confirmed, within one month of the suspension or
restriction, that there is no risk to health, safety or fundamental rights in relation to
certificates affected by the suspension or restriction, and the notifying authority has
outlined a timeline and actions anticipated to remedy the suspension or restriction; or

(b) the notifying authority has confirmed that no certificates relevant to the suspension
will be issued, amended or re-issued during the course of the suspension or
restriction, and states whether the notified body has the capability of continuing to
monitor and remain responsible for existing certificates issued for the period of the
suspension or restriction. In the event that the authority responsible for notified
bodies determines that the notified body does not have the capability to support
existing certificates issued, the provider shall provide to the national competent
authorities of the Member State in which the provider of the system covered by the
certificate has its registered place of business, within three months of the suspension
or restriction, a written confirmation that another qualified notified body is
temporarily assuming the functions of the notified body to monitor and remain
responsible for the certificates during the period of suspension or restriction.

2e. With the exception of certificates unduly issued, and where a designation has been
withdrawn, the certificates shall remain valid for a period of nine months in the following

cover those requirements.

3a. Where a harmonised standard is adopted by a European standardisation organisation and
proposed to the Commission for the publication of its reference in the Official Journal of
the European Union, the Commission shall assess the harmonised standard in accordance
with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012. When reference of a harmonised standard is
published in the Official Journal of the European Union, the Commission shall repeal acts 
referred to in paragraph 1 and 1b, or parts thereof which cover the same requirements set
out in Chapter 2 of this Title.

4. Where providers of high-risk AI systems do not comply with the common specifications
referred to in paragraph 1, they shall duly justify that they have adopted technical solutions
that meet the requirements referred to in Chapter II to a level at least equivalent thereto.
4b. When a Member State considers that a common specification does not entirely satisfy the
requirements set out in Chapter 2 of this Title, it shall inform the Commission thereof with
a detailed explanation and the Commission shall assess that information and, if
appropriate, amend the implementing act establishing the common specification in
question.

Article 42

Presumption of conformity with certain requirements

1. High-risk AI systems that have been trained and tested on data reflecting the specific
geographical, behavioural, contextual or functional setting within which they are intended
to be used shall be presumed to be in compliance with the respective requirements set out
in Article 10(4).

2. High-risk AI systems that have been certified or for which a statement of conformity has
been issued under a cybersecurity scheme pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the
European Parliament and of the Council1
and the references of which have been published
in the Official Journal of the European Union shall be presumed to be in compliance with
the cybersecurity requirements set out in Article 15 of this Regulation in so far as the
cybersecurity certificate or statement of conformity or parts thereof cover those
requirements.

Article 43

Conformity assessment

1. For high-risk AI systems listed in point 1 of Annex III, where, in demonstrating the
compliance of a high-risk AI system with the requirements set out in Chapter 2 of this
Title, the provider has applied harmonised standards referred to in Article 40, or, where 
applicable, common specifications referred to in Article 41, the provider shall opt for one
of the following procedures:

(a) the conformity assessment procedure based on internal control referred to in Annex
VI; or

(b) the conformity assessment procedure based on assessment of the quality
management system and assessment of the technical documentation, with the
involvement of a notified body, referred to in Annex VII.

In demonstrating the compliance of a high-risk AI system with the requirements set out in
Chapter 2 of this Title, the provider shall follow the conformity assessment procedure set
out in Annex VII in the following cases: (a) where harmonised standards referred to in
Article 40, do not exist and common specifications referred to in Article 41 are not
available; (aa) the provider has not applied or has applied only in part the harmonised
standard; (b) where the common specifications referred to in point (a) exist but the
provider has not applied them; (c) where one or more of the harmonised standards referred
to in point (a) has been published with a restriction and only on the part of the standard that
was restricted;

For the purpose of the conformity assessment procedure referred to in Annex VII, the
provider may choose any of the notified bodies. However, when the system is intended to
be put into service by law enforcement, immigration or asylum authorities as well as EU
institutions, bodies or agencies, the market surveillance authority referred to in Article
63(5) or (6), as applicable, shall act as a notified body.

2. For high-risk AI systems referred to in points 2 to 8 of Annex III providers shall follow the
conformity assessment procedure based on internal control as referred to in Annex VI,
which does not provide for the involvement of a notified body.

3. For high-risk AI systems, to which legal acts listed in Annex II, section A, apply, the
provider shall follow the relevant conformity assessment as required under those legal acts.
The requirements set out in Chapter 2 of this Title shall apply to those high-risk AI systems
and shall be part of that assessment. Points 4.3., 4.4., 4.5. and the fifth paragraph of point
4.6 of Annex VII shall also apply.

For the purpose of that assessment, notified bodies which have been notified under those
legal acts shall be entitled to control the conformity of the high-risk AI systems with the 
requirements set out in Chapter 2 of this Title, provided that the compliance of those
notified bodies with requirements laid down in Article 33(4), (9) and (10) has been
assessed in the context of the notification procedure under those legal acts.
Where the legal acts listed in Annex II, section A, enable the manufacturer of the product
to opt out from a third-party conformity assessment, provided that that manufacturer has
applied all harmonised standards covering all the relevant requirements, that manufacturer
may make use of that option only if he has also applied harmonised standards or, where
applicable, common specifications referred to in Article 41, covering the requirements set
out in Chapter 2 of this Title.

4. High-risk AI systems that have already been subject to a conformity assessment procedure
shall undergo a new conformity assessment procedure whenever they are substantially
modified, regardless of whether the modified system is intended to be further distributed or
continues to be used by the current deployer.

For high-risk AI systems that continue to learn after being placed on the market or put into
service, changes to the high-risk AI system and its performance that have been predetermined by the provider at the moment of the initial conformity assessment and are part
of the information contained in the technical documentation referred to in point 2(f) of
Annex IV, shall not constitute a substantial modification.

5. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 73 for
the purpose of updating Annexes VI and Annex VII in light of technical progress.

6. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts to amend paragraphs 1 and 2 in
order to subject high-risk AI systems referred to in points 2 to 8 of Annex III to the
conformity assessment procedure referred to in Annex VII or parts thereof. The
Commission shall adopt such delegated acts taking into account the effectiveness of the
conformity assessment procedure based on internal control referred to in Annex VI in
preventing or minimizing the risks to health and safety and protection of fundamental
rights posed by such systems as well as the availability of adequate capacities and
resources among notified bodies. 

Article 44

Certificates

1. Certificates issued by notified bodies in accordance with Annex VII shall be drawn-up in a
language which can be easily understood by the relevant authorities in the Member State in
which the notified body is established.

2. Certificates shall be valid for the period they indicate, which shall not exceed five years for
AI systems covered by Annex II and four years for AI systems covered by Annex III. On
application by the provider, the validity of a certificate may be extended for further
periods, each not exceeding five years for AI systems covered by Annex II and four years
for AI systems covered by Annex III, based on a re-assessment in accordance with the
applicable conformity assessment procedures. Any supplement to a certificate shall remain
valid as long as the certificate which it supplements is valid.

3. Where a notified body finds that an AI system no longer meets the requirements set out in
Chapter 2 of this Title, it shall, taking account of the principle of proportionality, suspend
or withdraw the certificate issued or impose any restrictions on it, unless compliance with
those requirements is ensured by appropriate corrective action taken by the provider of the
system within an appropriate deadline set by the notified body. The notified body shall
give reasons for its decision.

An appeal procedure against decisions of the notified bodies, including on issued
conformity certificates, shall be available.

Article 46

Information obligations of notified bodies

1. Notified bodies shall inform the notifying authority of the following:

(a) any Union technical documentation assessment certificates, any supplements to those
certificates, quality management system approvals issued in accordance with the
requirements of Annex VII;

(b) any refusal, restriction, suspension or withdrawal of a Union technical
documentation assessment certificate or a quality management system approval
issued in accordance with the requirements of Annex VII;

(c) any circumstances affecting the scope of or conditions for notification;

(d) any request for information which they have received from market surveillance
authorities regarding conformity assessment activities;

(e) on request, conformity assessment activities performed within the scope of their
notification and any other activity performed, including cross-border activities and

(a) quality management system approvals which it has refused, suspended or withdrawn,
and, upon request, of quality system approvals which it has issued;

(b) EU technical documentation assessment certificates or any supplements thereto
which it has refused, withdrawn, suspended or otherwise restricted, and, upon
request, of the certificates and/or supplements thereto which it has issued.

3. Each notified body shall provide the other notified bodies carrying out similar conformity
assessment activities covering the same types ofAI systems with relevant information on
issues relating to negative and, on request, positive conformity assessment results.

3a. The obligations referred to in paragraphs 1 to 3 shall be complied with in accordance with
Article 70.

Article 47

Derogation from conformity assessment procedure

1. 1. By way of derogation from Article 43 and upon a duly justified request, any market
surveillance authority may authorise the placing on the market or putting into service of
specific high-risk AI systems within the territory of the Member State concerned, for
exceptional reasons of public security or the protection of life and health of persons,
environmental protection and the protection of key industrial and infrastructural assets.
That authorisation shall be for a limited period of time while the necessary conformity 
assessment procedures are being carried out, taking into account the exceptional reasons
justifying the derogation. The completion of those procedures shall be undertaken without
undue delay.

1a. In a duly justified situation of urgency for exceptional reasons of public security or in case
of specific, substantial and imminent threat to the life or physical safety of natural persons,
law enforcement authorities or civil protection authorities may put a specific high-risk AI
system into service without the authorisation referred to in paragraph 1 provided that such
authorisation is requested during or after the use without undue delay, and if such
authorisation is rejected, its use shall be stopped with immediate effect and all the results
and outputs of this use shall be immediately discarded.

2. The authorisation referred to in paragraph 1 shall be issued only if the market surveillance
authority concludes that the high-risk AI system complies with the requirements of Chapter
2 of this Title. The market surveillance authority shall inform the Commission and the
other Member States of any authorisation issued pursuant to paragraph 1. This obligation
shall not cover sensitive operational data in relation to the activities of law enforcement
authorities.

3. Where, within 15 calendar days of receipt of the information referred to in paragraph 2, no
objection has been raised by either a Member State or the Commission in respect of an
authorisation issued by a market surveillance authority of a Member State in accordance
with paragraph 1, that authorisation shall be deemed justified.

4. Where, within 15 calendar days of receipt of the notification referred to in paragraph 2,
objections are raised by a Member State against an authorisation issued by a market
surveillance authority of another Member State, or where the Commission considers the
authorisation to be contrary to Union law or the conclusion of the Member States regarding
the compliance of the system as referred to in paragraph 2 to be unfounded, the
Commission shall without delay enter into consultation with the relevant Member State;
the operator(s) concerned shall be consulted and have the possibility to present their views.
In view thereof, the Commission shall decide whether the authorisation is justified or not.
The Commission shall address its decision to the Member State concerned and the relevant
operator or operators.

5. If the authorisation is considered unjustified, this shall be withdrawn by the market
surveillance authority of the Member State concerned. 

6. For high-risk AI systems related to products covered by Union harmonisation legislation
referred to in Annex II Section A, only the conformity assessment derogation procedures
established in that legislation shall apply.

Article 48

EU declaration of conformity for each high-risk AI system and keep it at the disposal of
the national competent authorities for 10 years after the AI high-risk system has been
placed on the market or put into service. The EU declaration of conformity shall identify
the high-risk AI system for which it has been drawn up.A copy of the EU declaration of
conformity shall be submitted to the relevant national competent authorities upon request.

2. The EU declaration of conformity shall state that the high-risk AI system in question meets
the requirements set out in Chapter 2 of this Title. The EU declaration of conformity shall
contain the information set out in Annex V and shall be translated into a language that can
be easily understood by the national competent authorities of the Member State(s) in which
the high-risk AI system is placed on the market or made available.

3. Where high-risk AI systems are subject to other Union harmonisation legislation which
also requires an EU declaration of conformity, a single EU declaration of conformity shall
be drawn up in respect of all Union legislations applicable to the high-risk AI system. The
declaration shall contain all the information required for identification of the Union
harmonisation legislation to which the declaration relates.

4. By drawing up the EU declaration of conformity, the provider shall assume responsibility
for compliance with the requirements set out in Chapter 2 of this Title. The provider shall
keep the EU declaration of conformity up-to-date as appropriate.

5. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 73
for the purpose of updating the content of the EU declaration of conformity set out in
Annex V in order to introduce elements that become necessary in light of technical
progress.

Article 49

CE marking of conformity

1. The CE marking of conformity shall be subject to the general principles set out in Article
30 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008.

1a. For high-risk AI systems provided digitally, a digital CE marking shall be used, only if it
can be easily accessed via the interface from which the AI system is accessed or via an
easily accessible machine-readable code or other electronic means.

2. The CE marking shall be affixed visibly, legibly and indelibly for high-risk AI systems.
Where that is not possible or not warranted on account of the nature of the high-risk AI
system, it shall be affixed to the packaging or to the accompanying documentation, as
appropriate.

3. Where applicable, the CE marking shall be followed by the identification number of the
notified body responsible for the conformity assessment procedures set out in Article 43.
The identification number of the notified body shall be affixed by the body itself or, under
its instructions, by the provider or by its authorised representative. The identification
number shall also be indicated in any promotional material which mentions that the highrisk AI system fulfils the requirements for CE marking.

3a. Where high-risk AI systems are subject to other Union law which also provides for the
affixing of the CE marking, the CE marking shall indicate that the high-risk AI system also
fulfil the requirements of that other law.

TITLE IV

TRANSPARENCY OBLIGATIONS FOR PROVIDERS AND
DEPLOYERS OF CERTAIN AI SYSTEMS AND GPAI MODELS

Article 52

Transparency obligations for providers and users of certain AI systems and GPAI models

1. Providers shall ensure that AI systems intended to directly interact with natural persons are
designed and developed in such a way that the concerned natural persons are informed that
they are interacting with an AI system, unless this is obvious from the point of view of a
natural person who is reasonably well-informed, observant and circumspect, taking into
account the circumstances and the context of use. This obligation shall not apply to AI
systems authorised by law to detect, prevent, investigate and prosecute criminal offences,
subject to appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of third parties unless those
systems are available for the public to report a criminal offence.

1a. Providers of AI systems, including GPAI systems, generating synthetic audio, image,
video or text content, shall ensure the outputs of the AI system are marked in a machinereadable format and detectable as artificially generated or manipulated. Providers shall
ensure their technical solutions are effective, interoperable, robust and reliable as far as this
is technically feasible, taking into account specificities and limitations of different types of
content, costs of implementation and the generally acknowledged state-of-the-art, as may
be reflected in relevant technical standards.

This obligation shall not apply to the extent the AI systems perform an assistive function
for standard editing or do not substantially alter the input data provided by the deployer or
the semantics thereof, or where authorised by law to detect, prevent, investigate and
prosecute criminal offences.

2. Deployers of an emotion recognition system or a biometric categorisation system shall
inform of the operation of the system the natural persons exposed thereto and process the
personal data in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679, Regulation (EU) 2016/1725
and Directive (EU) 2016/280, as applicable. This obligation shall not apply to AI systems
used for biometric categorization and emotion recognition, which are permitted by law to
detect, prevent and investigate criminal offences, subject to appropriate safeguards for the
rights and freedoms of third parties, and in compliance with Union law.

3. Deployers of an AI system that generates or manipulates image, audio or video content
constituting a deep fake, shall disclose that the content has been artificially generated or
manipulated. This obligation shall not apply where the use is authorised by law to detect,
prevent, investigate and prosecute criminal offence. Where the content forms part of an
evidently artistic, creative, satirical, fictional analogous work or programme, the
transparency obligations set out in this paragraph are limited to disclosure of the existence
of such generated or manipulated content in an appropriate manner that does not hamper
the display or enjoyment of the work.

Deployers of an AI system that generates or manipulates text which is published with the
purpose of informing the public on matters of public interest shall disclose that the text has
been artificially generated or manipulated. This obligation shall not apply where the use is
authorised by law to detect, prevent, investigate and prosecute criminal offences or where
the AI-generated content has undergone a process of human review or editorial control and
where a natural or legal person holds editorial responsibility for the publication of the
content.

3a. The information referred to in paragraphs 1 to 3 shall be provided to the concerned natural
persons in a clear and distinguishable manner at the latest at the time of the first interaction
or exposure. The information shall respect the applicable accessibility requirements.

4. Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not affect the requirements and obligations set out in Title III of
this Regulation and shall be without prejudice to other transparency obligations for users of
AI systems laid down in Union or national law.

4a. The AI Office shall encourage and facilitate the drawing up of codes of practice at
Union level to facilitate the effective implementation of the obligations regarding the
detection and labelling of artificially generated or manipulated content. The Commission is
empowered to adopt implementing acts to approve these codes of practice in accordance
with the procedure laid down in Article 52e paragraphs 6-8. If it deems the code is not
adequate, the Commission is empowered to adopt an implementing act specifying the
common rules for the implementation of those obligations in accordance with the
examination procedure laid down in Article 73 paragraph 2.

TITLE VIIIA GENERAL PURPOSE AI MODELS

CHAPTER 1 CLASSIFICATION RULES

Article 52a Classification of general-purpose AI models as general purpose AI models with
systemic risk

1. A general-purpose AI model shall be classified as general-purpose AI model with systemic
risk if it meets any of the following criteria:

(a) it has high impact capabilities evaluated on the basis of appropriate technical tools
and methodologies, including indicators and benchmarks;

(b) based on a decision of the Commission, ex officio or following a qualified alert by
the scientific panel that a general purpose AI model has capabilities or impact
equivalent to those of point a).

2. A general-purpose AI model shall be presumed to have high impact capabilities pursuant
to point a) of paragraph 1 when the cumulative amount of compute used for its training
measured in floating point operations (FLOPs) is greater than 10^25.

3. The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 73(2) to amend the
thresholds listed in the paragraphs above, as well as to supplement benchmarks and
indicators in light of evolving technological developments, such as algorithmic
improvements or increased hardware efficiency, when necessary, for these thresholds to
reflect the state of the art.

Article 52b

Procedure

1. Where a general-purpose AI model meets the requirements referred to in points (a) of
Article A(1), the relevant provider shall notify the Commission without delay and in any
event within 2 weeks after those requirements are met or it becomes known that these
requirements will be met. That notification shall include the information necessary to
demonstrate that the relevant requirements have been met. If the Commission becomes
aware of a general purpose AI model presenting systemic risks of which it has not been
notified, it may decide to designate it as a model with systemic risk.

2. The provider of a general-purpose AI model that meets the requirements referred to in
points (a) of Article A(1) may present, with its notification, sufficiently substantiated
arguments to demonstrate that, exceptionally, although it meets the said requirements, the 
general-purpose AI model does not present, due to its specific characteristics, systemic
risks and therefore should not be classified as general-purpose AI model with systemic
risk.

3. Where the Commission concludes that the arguments submitted pursuant to paragraph 2
are not sufficiently substantiated and the relevant provider was not able to demonstrate that
the general purpose AI model does not present, due to its specific characteristics, systemic
risks, it shall reject those arguments and the general-purpose AI model shall be considered
as general purpose AI model with systemic risk.

4. The Commission may designate a general purpose AI model as presenting systemic risks,
ex officio or following a qualified alert of the scientific panel pursuant to point (a) of
Article [Alerts of systemic risks by the scientific panel] (1) on the basis of criteria set out in
Annex YY. The Commission shall be empowered to specify and update the criteria in
Annex YY by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 74 (2).

4a. Upon a reasoned request of a provider whose model has been designated as a generalpurpose AI model with systemic risk pursuant to paragraph 4, the Commission shall take
the request into account and may decide to reassess whether the general-purpose AI model
can still be considered to present systemic risks on the basis of the criteria set out in Annex
YY. Such request shall contain objective, concrete and new reasons that have arisen since
the designation decision. Providers may request reassessment at the earliest six months
after the designation decision. Where the Commission, following its reassessment, decides
to maintain the designation as general-purpose AI model with systemic risk, providers may
request reassessment at the earliest six months after this decision.

5. The Commission shall ensure that a list of general-purpose AI models with systemic risk is
published and shall keep that list up to date, without prejudice to the need to respect and
protect intellectual property rights and confidential business information or trade secrets in
accordance with Union and national law.

Chapter II

TITLE V

MEASURES IN SUPPORT OF INNOVATION

Article 53

AI regulatory sandboxes

1. Member States shall ensure that their competent authorities establish at least one AI
regulatory sandbox at national level, which shall be operational 24 months after entry into
force. This sandbox may also be established jointly with one or several other Member
States’ competent authorities. The Commission may provide technical support, advice and
tools for the establishment and operation of AI regulatory sandboxes.

The obligation established in previous paragraph can also be fulfilled by participation in an
existing sandbox insofar as this participation provides equivalent level of national coverage
for the participating Member States.

1a. Additional AI regulatory sandboxes at regional or local levels or jointly with other
Member States' competent authorities may also be established;

1b. The European Data Protection Supervisor may also establish an AI regulatory sandbox for
the EU institutions, bodies and agencies and exercise the roles and the tasks of national
competent authorities in accordance with this chapter.

1c. Member States shall ensure that competent authorities referred to in paragraphs 1 and 1a
allocate sufficient resources to comply with this Article effectively and in a timely manner.
Where appropriate, national competent authorities shall cooperate with other relevant
authorities and may allow for the involvement of other actors within the AI ecosystem.
This Article shall not affect other regulatory sandboxes established under national or Union
law. Member States shall ensure an appropriate level of cooperation between the
authorities supervising those other sandboxes and the national competent authorities.

1d. AI regulatory sandboxes established under Article 53(1) of this Regulation shall, in
accordance with Articles 53 and 53a, provide for a controlled environment that fosters
innovation and facilitates the development, training, testing and validation of innovative AI
systems for a limited time before their placement on the market or putting into service
pursuant to a specific sandbox plan agreed between the prospective providers and the
competent authority. Such regulatory sandboxes may include testing in real world
conditions supervised in the sandbox.

1e. Competent authorities shall provide, as appropriate, guidance, supervision and support
within the sandbox with a view to identifying risks, in particular to fundamental rights,
health and safety, testing, mitigation measures, and their effectiveness in relation to the
obligations and requirements of this Regulation and, where relevant, other Union and
Member States legislation supervised within the sandbox.

1f. Competent authorities shall provide providers and prospective providers with guidance on
regulatory expectations and how to fulfil the requirements and obligations set out in this
Regulation.

Upon request of the provider or prospective provider of the AI system, the competent
authority shall provide a written proof of the activities successfully carried out in the
sandbox. The competent authority shall also provide an exit report detailing the activities
carried out in the sandbox and the related results and learning outcomes. Providers may use
such documentation to demonstrate the compliance with this Regulation through the 
conformity assessment process or relevant market surveillance activities. In this regard, the
exit reports and the written proof provided by the national competent authority shall be
taken positively into account by market surveillance authorities and notified bodies, with a
view to accelerate conformity assessment procedures to a reasonable extent.

1fa Subject to the confidentiality provisions in Article 70 and with the agreement of the
sandbox provider/prospective provider, the European Commission and the Board shall be
authorised to access the exit reports and shall take them into account, as appropriate, when
exercising their tasks under this Regulation. If both provider and prospective provider and
the national competent authority explicitly agree to this, the exit report can be made
publicly available through the single information platform referred to in this article.

1g. The establishment of AI regulatory sandboxes shall aim to contribute to the following
objectives:

a) improve legal certainty to achieve regulatory compliance with this Regulation or, where
relevant, other applicable Union and Member States legislation;

in the AI regulatory sandbox;

c) foster innovation and competitiveness and facilitate the development of an AI
ecosystem;

d) contribute to evidence-based regulatory learning;

e) facilitate and accelerate access to the Union market for AI systems, in particular when
provided by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), including start-ups.

2. National competent authorities shall ensure that, to the extent the innovative AI systems
involve the processing of personal data or otherwise fall under the supervisory remit of
other national authorities or competent authorities providing or supporting access to data,
the national data protection authorities, and those other national authorities are associated
to the operation of the AI regulatory sandbox and involved in the supervision of those
aspects to the extent of their respective tasks and powers, as applicable.

3. The AI regulatory sandboxes shall not affect the supervisory and corrective powers of the
competent authorities supervising the sandboxes, including at regional or local level. Any
significant risks to health and safety and fundamental rights identified during the
development and testing of such AI systems shall result in an adequate mitigation.
National competent authorities shall have the power to temporarily or permanently suspend
the testing process, or participation in the sandbox if no effective mitigation is possible and 
inform the AI Office of such decision. National competent authorities shall exercise their
supervisory powers within the limits of the relevant legislation, using their discretionary
powers when implementing legal provisions to a specific AI sandbox project, with the
objective of supporting innovation in AI in the Union.

4. Providers and prospective providers in the AI regulatory sandbox shall remain liable under
applicable Union and Member States liability legislation for any damage inflicted on third
parties as a result of the experimentation taking place in the sandbox. However, provided
that the prospective provider(s) respect the specific plan and the terms and conditions for
their participation and follow in good faith the guidance given by the national competent
authority, no administrative fines shall be imposed by the authorities for infringements of
this Regulation. To the extent that other competent authorities responsible for other Union
and Member States’ legislation have been actively involved in the supervision of the AI
system in the sandbox and have provided guidance for compliance, no administrative fines
shall be imposed regarding that legislation.

4b. The AI regulatory sandboxes shall be designed and implemented in such a way that,
where relevant, they facilitate cross-border cooperation between national competent
authorities.

5. National competent authorities shall coordinate their activities and cooperate within the
framework of the Board.

5a. National competent authorities shall inform the AI Office and the Board of the
establishment of a sandbox and may ask for support and guidance. A list of planned and
existing AI sandboxes shall be made publicly available by the AI Office and kept up to
date in order to encourage more interaction in the regulatory sandboxes and cross-border
cooperation.

5b. National competent authorities shall submit to the AI Office and to the Board, annual
reports, starting one year after the establishment of the AI regulatory sandbox and then
every year until its termination and a final report. Those reports shall provide information
on the progress and results of the implementation of those sandboxes, including best
practices, incidents, lessons learnt and recommendations on their setup and, where
relevant, on the application and possible revision of this Regulation, including its delegated
and implementing acts, and other Union law supervised within the sandbox. Those annual
reports or abstracts thereof shall be made available to the public, online. The Commission 
shall, where appropriate, take the annual reports into account when exercising their tasks
under this Regulation.

6. The Commission shall develop a single and dedicated interface containing all relevant
information related to sandboxes to allow stakeholders to interact with regulatory
sandboxes and to raise enquiries with competent authorities, and to seek non-binding
guidance on the conformity of innovative products, services, business models embedding
AI technologies, in accordance with Article 55(1)(c). The Commission shall proactively
coordinate with national competent authorities, where relevant.

ARTICLE 53A Modalities and functioning of AI regulatory sandboxes

termination of the AI regulatory sandbox, including the sandbox plan and the exit report;

c) the terms and conditions applicable to the participants.
The implementing acts shall ensure that:

a) regulatory sandboxes are open to any applying prospective provider of an AI system
who fulfils eligibility and selection criteria. The criteria for accessing to the regulatory
sandbox are transparent and fair and establishing authorities inform applicants of their
decision within 3 months of the application;

b) regulatory sandboxes allow broad and equal access and keep up with demand for
participation; prospective providers may also submit applications in partnerships with users
and other relevant third parties;

c) the modalities and conditions concerning regulatory sandboxes shall to the best extent
possible support flexibility for national competent authorities to establish and operate their
AI regulatory sandboxes;

d) access to the AI regulatory sandboxes is free of charge for SMEs and start-ups without
prejudice to exceptional costs that national competent authorities may recover in a fair and
proportionate manner;

e) they facilitate prospective providers, by means of the learning outcomes of the
sandboxes, to conduct the conformity assessment obligations of this Regulation or the
voluntary application of the codes of conduct referred to in Article 69;

f) regulatory sandboxes facilitate the involvement of other relevant actors within the AI
ecosystem, such as notified bodies and standardisation organisations (SMEs, start-ups,
enterprises, innovators, testing and experimentation facilities, research and
experimentation labs and digital innovation hubs, centers of excellence, individual
researchers), in order to allow and facilitate cooperation with the public and private sector;

g) procedures, processes and administrative requirements for application, selection,
participation and exiting the sandbox are simple, easily intelligible, clearly communicated
in order to facilitate the participation of SMEs and start-ups with limited legal and
administrative capacities and are streamlined across the Union, in order to avoid
fragmentation and that participation in a regulatory sandbox established by a Member
State, or by the EDPS is mutually and uniformly recognised and carries the same legal
effects across the Union;

h) participation in the AI regulatory sandbox is limited to a period that is appropriate to the
complexity and scale of the project. This period may be extended by the national
competent authority;

i) the sandboxes shall facilitate the development of tools and infrastructure for testing,
benchmarking, assessing and explaining dimensions of AI systems relevant for regulatory
learning , such as accuracy, robustness and cybersecurity as well as measures to mitigate
risks to fundamental rights,[environment] and the society at large.

3. Prospective providers in the sandboxes, in particular SMEs and start-ups, shall be
directed, where relevant, to pre-deployment services such as guidance on the
implementation of this Regulation, to other value-adding services such as help with
standardisation documents and certification, Testing & Experimentation Facilities, Digital
Hubs, Centres of Excellence, and [EU benchmarking capabilities].

4. When national competent authorities consider authorising testing in real world conditions
supervised within the framework of an AI regulatory sandbox established under this
Article, they shall specifically agree with the participants on the terms and conditions of
such testing and in particular on the appropriate safeguards with the view to protect
fundamental rights, health and safety. Where appropriate, they shall cooperate with other
national competent authorities with a view to ensure consistent practices across the Union.

Article 65a

Procedure for dealing with AI systems classified by the provider as a not high-risk in
application of Annex III

1. Where a market surveillance authority has sufficient reasons to consider that an AI system
classified by the provider as non high-risk in application of Annex III is high-risk, they
market surveillance authority shall carry out an evaluation of the AI system concerned in
respect of its classification as a high-risk AI system based on the conditions set out in
Annex III and the Commission guidelines.

2. Where, in the course of that evaluation, the market surveillance authority finds that the AI
system concerned is high-risk, it shall without undue delay require the relevant provider to
take all necessary actions to bring the AI system into compliance with the requirements
and obligations laid down in this Regulation as well as take appropriate corrective action
within a period it may prescribe.

3. Where the market surveillance authority considers that the use of the AI system concerned
is not restricted to its national territory, it shall inform the Commission and the other
Member States without undue delay of the results of the evaluation and of the actions
which it has required the provider to take.

4. The provider shall ensure that all necessary action is taken to bring the AI system into
compliance with the requirements and obligations laid down in this Regulation. Where the
provider of an AI system concerned does not bring the AI system into compliance with the
requirements and obligations of this Regulation within the period referred to in paragraph
2, the provider shall be subject to fines in accordance with Article 71.

5. The provider shall ensure that all appropriate corrective action is taken in respect of all the
AI systems concerned that it has made available on the market throughout the Union.

6. Where the provider of the AI system concerned does not take adequate corrective action
within the period referred to in paragraph 2, then the provisions of Article 65 paragraphs 5
to 9 apply.

7. Where, in the course of that evaluation pursuant to paragraph 1, the market surveillance
authority establishes that the AI system was misclassified by the provider as not high-risk 
to circumvent the application of requirements in Title III, Chapter 2, the provider shall be
subject to fines in accordance with Article 71.

8. In exercising their power to monitor the application of this article and in accordance with
Article 11 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, market surveillance authorities may perform
appropriate checks, taking into account in particular information stored in the EU database
referred to in Article 60.

1. Where, within three months of receipt of the notification referred to in Article 65(5), or 30
days in the case of non-compliance with the prohibition of the artificial intelligence
practices referred to in Article 5, objections are raised by the market surveillance authority
of a Member State against a measure taken by another market surveillance authority, or
where the Commission considers the measure to be contrary to Union law, the Commission
shall without undue delay enter into consultation with the market surveillance authority of
the relevant Member State and operator or operators and shall evaluate the national
measure. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall decide
whether the national measure is justified or not within six months, or 60 days in the case of
non-compliance with the prohibition of the artificial intelligence practices referred to in
Article 5, starting from the notification referred to in Article 65(5) and notify such decision
to the market surveillance authority of the Member State concerned. The Commission shall
also inform all other market surveillance authorities of such decision.

2. If the measure taken by the relevant Member States is considered justified by the
Commission, all Member States shall ensure that appropriate restrictive measures are taken
in respect of the AI system concerned, such as withdrawal of the AI system from their
market without undue delay, and shall inform the Commission accordingly. If the national
measure is considered unjustified by the Commission, the Member State concerned shall
withdraw the measure and inform the Commission accordingly.

3. Where the national measure is considered justified and the non-compliance of the AI
system is attributed to shortcomings in the harmonised standards or common specifications
referred to in Articles 40 and 41 of this Regulation, the Commission shall apply the
procedure provided for in Article 11 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012.

Article 67

The notification shall contain the conclusions of the assessment of the quality management
system and the reasoned assessment decision.

3.3. The quality management system as approved shall continue to be implemented and
maintained by the provider so that it remains adequate and efficient.

3.4. Any intended change to the approved quality management system or the list of AI systems
covered by the latter shall be brought to the attention of the notified body by the provider.
The proposed changes shall be examined by the notified body, which shall decide whether
the modified quality management system continues to satisfy the requirements referred to
in point 3.2 or whether a reassessment is necessary.

The notified body shall notify the provider of its decision. The notification shall contain
the conclusions of the examination of the changes and the reasoned assessment decision.

4. Control of the technical documentation.

4.1. In addition to the application referred to in point 3, an application with a notified body of
their choice shall be lodged by the provider for the assessment of the technical
documentation relating to the AI system which the provider intends to place on the market
or put into service and which is covered by the quality management system referred to
under point 3.

4.2. The application shall include:

(a) the name and address of the provider;

(b) a written declaration that the same application has not been lodged with any other
notified body;

(c) the technical documentation referred to in Annex IV.

4.3. The technical documentation shall be examined by the notified body. Where relevant and

access to the training, validation, and testing datasets used, including, where appropriate
and subject to security safeguards, through application programming interfaces (API) or
other relevant technical means and tools enabling remote access.

4.4. In examining the technical documentation, the notified body may require that the provider
supplies further evidence or carries out further tests so as to enable a proper assessment of
conformity of the AI system with the requirements set out in Title III, Chapter 2.
Whenever the notified body is not satisfied with the tests carried out by the provider, the
notified body shall directly carry out adequate tests, as appropriate.

4.5. Where necessary to assess the conformity of the high-risk AI system with the requirements
set out in Title III, Chapter 2, after all other reasonable ways to verify conformity have
been exhausted and have proven to be insufficient, and upon a reasoned request, the
notified body shall also be granted access to the training and trained models of the AI
system, including its relevant parameters. Such access shall be subject to existing Union
law on the protection of intellectual property and trade secrets.

4.6. The decision shall be notified to the provider or its authorised representative. The
notification shall contain the conclusions of the assessment of the technical documentation
and the reasoned assessment decision.

Where the AI system is in conformity with the requirements set out in Title III, Chapter 2,
an EU technical documentation assessment certificate shall be issued by the notified body.
The certificate shall indicate the name and address of the provider, the conclusions of the
examination, the conditions (if any) for its validity and the data necessary for the
identification of the AI system.

The certificate and its annexes shall contain all relevant information to allow the
conformity of the AI system to be evaluated, and to allow for control of the AI system
while in use, where applicable.
