Ti=Transparency information referred to in Article 53(1), point (b) â€” technical documentation for {_providers} of {_general-purpose_AI_models} to {_downstream_providers} that integrate the model into their {_AI_system}

0.sec=The information referred to in Article 53(1), point (b) shall contain at least the following:

1.0.sec=A general description of the {_general-purpose_AI_model} including:

1.1.sec=the tasks that the model is intended to perform and the type and nature of {_AI_systems} into which it can be integrated;

1.2.sec=the acceptable use policies applicable;

1.3.sec=the date of release and methods of distribution;

1.4.sec=how the model interacts, or can be used to interact, with hardware or software that is not part of the model itself, where applicable;

1.5.sec=the versions of relevant software related to the use of the {_general-purpose_AI_model}, where applicable;

1.6.sec=the architecture and number of parameters;

1.7.sec=the modality (e.g. text, image) and format of inputs and outputs;

1.8.sec=the licence for the model.

1.=[G/Z/ol-a/s8]

2.0.sec=A description of the elements of the model and of the process for its development, including:

2.1.sec=the technical means (e.g. {_instructions_for_use}, infrastructure, tools) required for the {_general-purpose_AI_model} to be integrated into {_AI_systems};

2.2.sec=the modality (e.g. text, image, etc.) and format of the inputs and outputs and their maximum size (e.g. context window length, etc.);

2.3.sec=information on the data used for training, testing and validation, where applicable, including the type and provenance of data and curation methodologies.
