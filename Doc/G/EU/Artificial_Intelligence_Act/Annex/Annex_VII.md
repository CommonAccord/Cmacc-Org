ANNEX VII

Conformity based on an assessment of the quality management system and an assessment of the technical documentation

1.sec=Introduction

Conformity based on an assessment of the quality management system and an assessment of the technical documentation is the {_conformity_assessment} procedure based on points 2 to 5.

2.sec=Overview

The approved quality management system for the design, development and testing of {_AI_systems} pursuant to Article 17 shall be examined in accordance with point 3 and shall be subject to surveillance as specified in point 5. The technical documentation of the {_AI_system} shall be examined in accordance with point 4.

3.sec=Quality management system

3.1.

The application of the {_provider} shall include:
(a) the name and address of the {_provider} and, if the application is lodged by an {_authorised_representative}, also their name and address;

(b) the list of {_AI_systems} covered under the same quality management system;

(c) the technical documentation for each {_AI_system} covered under the same quality management system;

(d) the documentation concerning the quality management system which shall cover all the aspects listed under Article 17;

(e) a description of the procedures in place to ensure that the quality management system remains adequate and effective;

(f) a written declaration that the same application has not been lodged with any other {_notified_body}.

3.2.

The quality management system shall be assessed by the {_notified_body}, which shall determine whether it satisfies the requirements referred to in Article 17.
The decision shall be notified to the {_provider} or its {_authorised_representative}.

The notification shall contain the conclusions of the assessment of the quality management system and the reasoned assessment decision.

3.3.

The quality management system as approved shall continue to be implemented and maintained by the {_provider} so that it remains adequate and efficient.
3.4.

Any intended change to the approved quality management system or the list of {_AI_systems} covered by the latter shall be brought to the attention of the {_notified_body} by the {_provider}.
The proposed changes shall be examined by the {_notified_body}, which shall decide whether the modified quality management system continues to satisfy the requirements referred to in point 3.2 or whether a reassessment is necessary.

The {_notified_body} shall notify the {_provider} of its decision. The notification shall contain the conclusions of the examination of the changes and the reasoned assessment decision.

4.sec=Control of the technical documentation.

4.1.

In addition to the application referred to in point 3, an application with a {_notified_body} of their choice shall be lodged by the {_provider} for the assessment of the technical documentation relating to the {_AI_system} which the {_provider} intends to place on the market or put into service and which is covered by the quality management system referred to under point 3.
4.2.

The application shall include:
(a) the name and address of the {_provider};

(b) a written declaration that the same application has not been lodged with any other {_notified_body};

(c) the technical documentation referred to in Annex IV.

4.3.

The technical documentation shall be examined by the {_notified_body}. Where relevant, and limited to what is necessary to fulfil its tasks, the {_notified_body} shall be granted full access to the training, validation, and {_testing_data} sets used, including, where appropriate and subject to security safeguards, through API or other relevant technical means and tools enabling remote access.
4.4.

In examining the technical documentation, the {_notified_body} may require that the {_provider} supply further evidence or carry out further tests so as to enable a proper assessment of the conformity of the {_AI_system} with the requirements set out in Chapter III, Section 2. Where the {_notified_body} is not satisfied with the tests carried out by the {_provider}, the {_notified_body} shall itself directly carry out adequate tests, as appropriate.
4.5.

Where necessary to assess the conformity of the high-{_risk} {_AI_system} with the requirements set out in Chapter III, Section 2, after all other reasonable means to verify conformity have been exhausted and have proven to be insufficient, and upon a reasoned request, the {_notified_body} shall also be granted access to the training and trained models of the {_AI_system}, including its relevant parameters. Such access shall be subject to existing Union law on the protection of intellectual property and trade secrets.
4.6.

The decision of the {_notified_body} shall be notified to the {_provider} or its {_authorised_representative}. The notification shall contain the conclusions of the assessment of the technical documentation and the reasoned assessment decision.
Where the {_AI_system} is in conformity with the requirements set out in Chapter III, Section 2, the {_notified_body} shall issue a Union technical documentation assessment certificate. The certificate shall indicate the name and address of the {_provider}, the conclusions of the examination, the conditions (if any) for its validity and the data necessary for the identification of the {_AI_system}.

The certificate and its annexes shall contain all relevant information to allow the conformity of the {_AI_system} to be evaluated, and to allow for control of the {_AI_system} while in use, where applicable.

Where the {_AI_system} is not in conformity with the requirements set out in Chapter III, Section 2, the {_notified_body} shall refuse to issue a Union technical documentation assessment certificate and shall inform the applicant accordingly, giving detailed reasons for its refusal.

Where the {_AI_system} does not meet the requirement relating to the data used to train it, re-training of the {_AI_system} will be needed prior to the application for a new {_conformity_assessment}. In this case, the reasoned assessment decision of the {_notified_body} refusing to issue the Union technical documentation assessment certificate shall contain specific considerations on the quality data used to train the {_AI_system}, in particular on the reasons for non-compliance.

4.7.

Any change to the {_AI_system} that could affect the compliance of the {_AI_system} with the requirements or its {_intended_purpose} shall be assessed by the {_notified_body} which issued the Union technical documentation assessment certificate. The {_provider} shall inform such {_notified_body} of its intention to introduce any of the abovementioned changes, or if it otherwise becomes aware of the occurrence of such changes. The intended changes shall be assessed by the {_notified_body}, which shall decide whether those changes require a new {_conformity_assessment} in accordance with Article 43(4) or whether they could be addressed by means of a supplement to the Union technical documentation assessment certificate. In the latter case, the {_notified_body} shall assess the changes, notify the {_provider} of its decision and, where the changes are approved, issue to the {_provider} a supplement to the Union technical documentation assessment certificate.
5.sec=Surveillance of the approved quality management system.

5.1.

The purpose of the surveillance carried out by the {_notified_body} referred to in Point 3 is to make sure that the {_provider} duly complies with the terms and conditions of the approved quality management system.
5.2.

For assessment purposes, the {_provider} shall allow the {_notified_body} to access the premises where the design, development, testing of the {_AI_systems} is taking place. The {_provider} shall further share with the {_notified_body} all necessary information.
5.3.

The {_notified_body} shall carry out periodic audits to make sure that the {_provider} maintains and applies the quality management system and shall provide the {_provider} with an audit report. In the context of those audits, the {_notified_body} may carry out additional tests of the {_AI_systems} for which a Union technical documentation assessment certificate was issued.
