Topic.Ti=Our AI Access Principles

Topic.0.sec=The foregoing tenets come together to shape the new principles we are announcing below. It’s important to note that, given the safety, security, privacy, and other issues relating to responsible AI, we need to apply all these principles subject to objective and effective standards to comply with our legal obligations and protect the public. These are discussed further below. Subject to these requirements, we are committed to the following 11 principles:

Topic.1.Ti=Provide access and support for AI developers who create models and applications

Topic.1.0.sec=We are committed to enabling AI innovation and fostering competition by making our cloud computing and AI infrastructure, platforms, tools, and services broadly available and accessible to software developers around the world. We want Microsoft Azure to be the best place for developers to train, build, and deploy AI models and to use those models safely and securely in applications and solutions. This means:

Topic.1.xlist=<ol start=1><li>{1.Sec}</li><li>{2.Sec}</li></ol>

1.Ti=As we grow chip capacity, we are expanding Microsoft’s cloud computing AI infrastructure to enable the training and deployment of more foundation models, both proprietary and open source, and large and small

1.1.sec=Today, our partnership with OpenAI is supporting the training of the next generation of OpenAI models and increasingly enabling customers to access and use these models and Microsoft’s CoPilot applications in local datacenters. At the same time, we are committed to supporting other developers, training, and deploying proprietary and open-source AI models, both large and small.

1.2.sec=Today’s important announcement with Mistral AI launches a new generation of Microsoft’s support for technology development in Europe. It enables Mistral AI to accelerate the development and deployment of its next generation Large Language Models (LLMs) with access to Azure’s cutting-edge AI infrastructure. It also makes the deployment of Mistral AI’s premium models available to customers through our Models-as-a-Service (MaaS) offering on Microsoft Azure, which model developers can use to publish and monetize their AI models. By providing a unified platform for AI model management, we aim to lower the barriers and costs of AI model development around the world for both open source and proprietary development. In addition to Mistral AI, this service is already hosting more than 1,600 open source and proprietary models from companies and organizations such as <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ai-machine-learning-blog/welcoming-mistral-phi-jais-code-llama-nvidia-nemotron-and-more/ba-p/3982699">Meta, Nvidia, Deci, and Hugging Face, with more models coming soon from Cohere and G42</a>.

1.3.sec=We are committed to expanding this type of support for additional models in the months and years ahead.

2.Ti=We are making AI models and development tools broadly available to software applications developers around the world, so every nation can build its own AI economy

2.1.sec=As reflected in Microsoft’s Copilots and OpenAI’s ChatGPT itself, the world is rapidly benefiting from the use of a new generation of software applications that access and use the power of AI models. But our applications will represent just a small percentage of the AI-powered applications the world will need and create. For this reason, we’re committed to ongoing and innovative steps to make the AI models we host and the development tools we create broadly available to AI software applications developers around the world in ways that are consistent with responsible AI principles.

2.2.sec=This includes the Azure OpenAI service, which enables software developers who work at start-ups, established IT companies, and in-house IT departments to build software applications that call on and make use of OpenAI’s most powerful models. It extends through Models as a Service to the use of other open source and proprietary AI models from other companies, including Mistral AI, Meta, and others.

2.3.sec=We are also committed to empowering developers to build customized AI solutions by enabling them to fine-tune existing models based on their own unique data sets and for their specific needs and scenarios. With Azure Machine Learning, developers can easily access state-of-the-art pre-trained models and customize them with their own data and parameters, using a simple drag-and-drop interface or code-based notebooks. This helps companies, governments, and non-profits create AI applications that help advance their goals and solve their challenges, such as improving customer service, enhancing public safety, or promoting social good. This is rapidly democratizing AI and fostering a culture of even broader innovation and collaboration among developers.

2.4.sec=We are also providing developers with tools and repositories on GitHub that enable them to create, share, and learn from AI solutions. GitHub is the world’s largest and most trusted platform for software development, hosting over 100 million repositories and supporting more than 40 million developers. We are committed to supporting the AI developer community by making our AI tools and resources available on GitHub, giving developers access to the latest innovations and best practices in AI development, as well as the opportunity to collaborate with other developers and contribute to the open source community. As one example, just last week we made available an <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/02/22/announcing-microsofts-open-automation-framework-to-red-team-generative-ai-systems/">open automation framework to help red team generative AI systems</a>.

For developers who choose to use Microsoft Azure, we want to make sure they are confident we will not tilt the playing field to our advantage. This means:

Topic.2.xlist=<ol start=3><li>{3.Sec}</li><li>{4.Sec}</li><li>{5.Sec}</li><li>{6.Sec}</li><li>{7.Sec}</li></ol>

3.Ti=We are making available public APIs to enable developers to access and use AI models we host on Microsoft Azure

3.sec=The AI models that we host on Azure, including the Microsoft Azure OpenAI API service, are all accessible via public APIs. Microsoft publishes documentation on its website explaining how developers can call these APIs and use the underlying models. This enables any application, whether it is built and deployed on Azure or other private and public clouds, to call these APIs and access the underlying models.

4.Ti=We are supporting a common public API to enable network operators to support software developers

4.1.sec=Network operators are playing a vital role in accelerating the AI transformation of customers around the world, including for many national and regional governments. This is one reason we are supporting a common public API through the Open Gateway initiative driven by the GSM Association, which advances innovation in the mobile ecosystem. The initiative is aligning all operators with a common API for exposing advanced capabilities provided by their networks, including authentication, location, and quality of service. It’s an indispensable step forward in enabling network operators to offer their advanced capabilities to a new generation of AI-enabled software developers. We have believed in the potential of this initiative since its inception at GSMA, and we have partnered with operators around the world to help bring it to life.

4.2.sec=Today at Mobile World Congress, we are launching the Public Preview of Azure Programmable Connectivity (APC). This is a first-class service in Azure, completely integrated with the rest of our services, that seamlessly provides access to Open Gateway for developers. It means software developers can use the capabilities provided by the operator network directly from Azure, like any other service, without requiring specific work for each operator.

5.Ti=Developers may choose how to distribute and sell their AI models, tools and applications for deployment and use on Microsoft Azure, whether via the Azure Marketplace or directly to customers

5.sec=We are committed to maintaining Microsoft Azure as an open cloud platform, much as Windows has been for decades and continues to be. That means in part ensuring that developers can choose how they want to distribute and sell their AI software to customers for deployment and use on Microsoft Azure. We provide a marketplace on Azure through which developers can list and sell their AI software to Azure customers under a variety of supported business models. Developers who choose to use the Azure Marketplace are also free to decide whether to use the transaction capabilities offered by the marketplace (at a modest fee) or whether to sell licenses to customers outside of the marketplace (at no fee). And, of course, developers remain free to sell and distribute AI software to Azure customers however they choose, and those customers can then upload, deploy, and use that software on Azure.

6.Ti=We respect the needs of developers by ensuring we do not use any non-public information or data from the training, building, deployment, or use of developers’ AI models in Microsoft Azure to compete with those models

6.sec=We believe that trust is central to the success of Microsoft Azure. We build this trust by serving the interests of AI developers and customers who choose Microsoft Azure to train, build, and deploy foundation models. In practice, this also means that we avoid using any non-public information or data from the training, building, deployment, or use of developers’ AI models to compete against them.

7.Ti=We enable customers using Microsoft Azure to switch to another cloud provider by enabling them to easily export and transfer their data

7.sec=We know that customers can and do use multiple cloud providers to meet their AI and other computing needs. And we understand that the data our customers store on Microsoft Azure is their data. So, we are committed to enabling customers to easily export and transfer their data if they choose to switch to another cloud provider. We recognize that different countries are considering or have enacted laws limiting the extent to which we can pass along the costs of such export and transfer. We will comply with those laws.

Topic.3.Ti=Meet our societal responsibilities
