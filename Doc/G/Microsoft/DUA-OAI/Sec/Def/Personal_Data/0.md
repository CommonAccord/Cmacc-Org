Ti=Personal Data

1.sec=“{DefT.Personal_Data}” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person and any other information that constitutes personal data or personal information under any applicable law.

2.sec=An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by referencing an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person.

Comment: This definition of Personal Data leverages the definition set out in the GDPR, but also extends to any other information deemed “personal data” or “personal information” by applicable law. So, for example, this definition would cover protected health information (PHI) if the data is regulated by HIPAA, because PHI is defined in 45 CFR 160.103 as “individually identifiable health information.”
