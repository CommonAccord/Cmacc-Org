Comment: As a default, this form does not permit any third party to enforce the terms of this Agreement, since many of the terms relate to specific obligations as between the Data Provider and Data User (e.g., Data Provider’s obligation to provide the data, or any commitments given by the Data Provider as to quality or provenance, and Data User’s obligations with respect to retention and protection of the data). However, end users of the Trained Model should be able to invoke Section 4b in the event a Data Provider claims a proprietary interest in downstream works or other creations and so that has been added as an exception.
