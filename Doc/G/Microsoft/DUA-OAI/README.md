# Microsoft-DUA-OAI
Cmacc version of the third form of Microsoft Data Use Agreement - for Open AI - https://news.microsoft.com/datainnovation/

This is a Prose Object format of the Microsoft original.  It is available as a <a href="http://www.commonaccord.org/i.php?v=s&f=G/Microsoft/DUA-OAI/Demo/Acme-Quake.md">demo</a>, as a <a href="http://www.commonaccord.org/i.php?v=l&f=G/Microsoft/DUA-OAI/">library</a>, and as a <a href="https://github.com/CommonAccord/Microsoft-DUA-OAI">repo</a>. 

The /Form/ has been modularized as sections under /Sec/ and given meaningful names, e.g., /Sec/Permission/, /Sec/DataProtect/.

The "General Terms" have be modularized as subsections under /Sec/Misc/, for instance /Sec/Misc/Assign/.  Note that these could be used as a seed general library for "General Terms".  Also note that the hyphenated ones indicate that they should probably be broken up a bit more into individual subjects, e.g. /Sec/Misc/Amend-Entire/. 

The {_Defined_Terms} have been parameterized, as have the cross-references, e.g. {Misc.Xnum}.

The Attachments are modularized under /Form/Annex/.  The directions for completing the Attachments are expressed as parameters, to be over-written in an actual use.
