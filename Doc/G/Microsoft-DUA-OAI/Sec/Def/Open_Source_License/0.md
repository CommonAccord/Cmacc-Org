Ti=Open Source License

sec=“{_Open_Source_License}” means a license that meets all of the requirements of the “The Open Source Definition” as published by the Open Source Initiative at <a href="https://opensource.org/osd">https://opensource.org/osd</a>.

Comment: The definition published by the Open Source Initiative is familiar to, and generally accepted by, the open source community. Many of the most common open source licenses in use today, such as the MIT license, would satisfy the definition.
