Ti=AI Model

sec=“{_AI_Model}” means the machine learning algorithm described in Attachment A, including associated parameters and associated weights, if present.

Comment: This definition contemplates that the AI Model may be an entirely untrained machine learning algorithm, without any associated parameters or weights, or that it may be a partially trained algorithm. Attachment A should be used to identify and describe the particular AI Model that will be Trained by Data User.
