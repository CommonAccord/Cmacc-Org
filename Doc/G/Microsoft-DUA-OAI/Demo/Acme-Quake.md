Note=This is a demo of the Microsoft Data Use Agreement for Open AI.  The original is the third item at <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/datainnovation/#data-use-agreements">https://news.microsoft.com/datainnovation/#data-use-agreements</a>.  This uses the variation that assumes a pre-existing NDA between the parties (the version without NDA is also available as /-WithoutNDA/).  

Note=Two choices are made here.  We permit the Data User to pass on rights in Trained Models to 3rd Parties.  (Misc.3rdParty.sec={Misc.3rdParty.Permit3rdPartyRightsInTrainedModel.sec}).  We also select the optional provision for Limited Liability and parameterize the amount (LI means to include the &lt;li> and &lt;/li> tags).  But that provision can be eliminated  (Misc.IfLimitedLiability.Sec={Misc.LimitLiability.Delete}).
