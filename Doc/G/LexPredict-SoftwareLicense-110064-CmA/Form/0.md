Schedule C to the Software License Agreement ("Agreement") By and Between Validian Corporation and Ganthet Mobile Corporation dated November 16, 2016

The Software Support and Maintenance Agreement

Introduction

THIS SOFTWARE SUPPORT and MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT (“SSMA”) is entered into between {_P1} Corporation, referred to herein as “{_P1}”, and GANTHET MOBILE CORPORATION, the holder of this license, referred to herein as “{_P2}”.

The terms of this SMA are as follows:

Section 1.  Software Maintenance Services

1.1

{_P1} agrees to provide to {_P2} corrected or modified versions of the Software distributed as either patches to existing releases, or as maintenance releases or new versions of the Software that {_P1} makes generally available to end-users and any master keys or root keys necessary to operate and use the Software.

1.2

Such modifications, when delivered and installed, shall become part of the Software and shall otherwise be subject to all of the terms of the License Agreement to which this SSMA is incorporated by reference.

1.3

New versions are major releases of the software in which platform upgrades, substantial additional functionality or improved performance are provided.  Under this maintenance agreement, {_P2} has the right to receive any new Realm Credentials and to upgrade their license to the new version of the software to replace existing versions as long as {_P2} is current in payment of any fees under the License Agreement and SSMA have not been terminated.

Section 2.  Error Correction Services

2.1

{_P1} shall use reasonable commercial efforts to correct or provide a usable work-around solution for any Critical Error or reproducible material error in the Software, within a reasonable period of time.  {_P1} agrees, if feasible, to commence correction within twenty-four (24) hours after such error or malfunction is detected.  If {_P1}, in its discretion, requests written verification of an error or malfunction discovered by {_P2}, {_P2} shall promptly provide such verification, by email, fax, or overnight mail, setting forth in reasonable detail the respects in which the Software fails to perform.  An error or malfunction shall be “material” if it represents a non-conformity with {_P1}'s current published specifications for the Software that interferes with the usability of the Software.  {_P1} is not obligated to fix errors that are not material.  Upon request, {_P2} shall provide {_P1} remote access to {_P2}’s computer system for the purpose of remote diagnostics.

2.2

{_P2} shall pay {_P1} at {_P1}'s then current time and material rates for work of {_P1} spent investigating an error or malfunction that {_P1} reasonably determines to have been caused by a modification to the Software not made nor authorized by {_P1}.



Section 3.  Telephone Support

3.1

{_P1} shall make reasonable email and/or telephone support available to {_P2}'s designated individual(s) who have been trained in the use of {_P1} software products. Email and telephone support is available between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Eastern Time (ET), Monday to Friday excluding U.S. and Canadian National Holidays, and consists of problem validation and logging, and preliminary diagnosis of the reported problem.  The intent is to identify a remedy or an avoidance procedure directly by email or over the telephone.

Section 4. Request for Modification of the Software Products

4.1

{_P2} may at any time request that {_P1} make additional modifications to the Software Products to add functions or improve performance.  {_P1} shall respond to a request for such work with the terms on which it may be willing to undertake such work, but the decision to do so is in the sole discretion of {_P1}.

Section 5.  Delivery

5.1

In order to satisfy any delivery obligation, {_P1} may, at its option, send, have delivered to, or email to {_P2} corrected Program(s), patches, modifications, error corrections, fixes, or releases to the Software provided pursuant to this Agreement, together with installation instructions.

Section 6. Intellectual Property

6.1

All modifications to the Software, including all intellectual property rights associated therewith, made or provided by {_P1} pursuant to this Agreement, whether alone or with any contribution from {_P2} or its personnel, shall be owned exclusively by {_P1} and its licensors.

7.1

This Agreement and the SSMA shall commence on the Effective Date, as set forth on page 1 of the License Agreement unless sooner terminated in accordance with this Section or the License Agreement.

7.3

No termination of this Agreement and SSMA shall release {_P2} from any obligation to pay {_P1} any amount that has accrued or become payable at or prior to the date of termination.

Section 8.   Miscellaneous

8.1

The date on which {_P1}'s obligations are required to be fulfilled will be extended for a period equal to the time lost by reason of any delay arising directly or indirectly from acts of God, unforeseeable circumstances, or any other cause beyond {_P1}'s reasonable control.

8.2
