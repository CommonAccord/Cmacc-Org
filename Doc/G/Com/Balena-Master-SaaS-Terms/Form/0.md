7.Ti=Indemnity

7.sec={_Company} shall hold {_Customer} harmless from liability to third parties resulting from infringement by the Service of any United States patent or any copyright or misappropriation of any trade secret, provided {_Company} is promptly notified of any and all threats, claims and proceedings related thereto and given reasonable assistance and the opportunity to assume sole control over defense and settlement; {_Company} will not be responsible for any settlement it does not approve in writing. The foregoing obligations do not apply with respect to portions or components of the {_Service} (i) not supplied by {_Company}, (ii) made in whole or in part in accordance with {_Customer} specifications, (iii) that are modified after delivery by {_Company}, (iv) combined with other products, processes or materials where the alleged infringement relates to such combination, (v) where {_Customer} continues allegedly infringing activity after being notified thereof or after being informed of modifications that would have avoided the alleged infringement, or (vi) where {_Customer}’s use of the {_Service} is not strictly in accordance with this {_Agreement}. If, due to a claim of infringement, the {_Services} are held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be or are believed by {_Company} to be infringing, {_Company} may, at its option and expense (a) replace or modify the {_Service} to be non-infringing provided that such modification or replacement contains substantially similar features and functionality, (b) obtain for {_Customer} a license to continue using the {_Service}, or (c) if neither of the foregoing is commercially practicable, terminate this {_Agreement} and {_Customer}’s rights hereunder and provide {_Customer} a refund of any prepaid, unused fees for the {_Service}.
