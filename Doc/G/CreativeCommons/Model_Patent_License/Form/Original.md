Licensor may use the information provided by Licensee to analyze and publish metrics and impact statistics related to the use of the Licensed Patent Rights and have others do so, as long as such information is used only in aggregated and anonymous form.

Licensee shall immediately notify Licensor upon the occurrence of one of these conditions.

Licensor may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Licensee in the event that Licensee asserts a claim of patent infringement against Licensor or any third party with respect to products or services of Licensor, unless (a) such claim is first asserted after Licensor has asserted a claim of patent infringement against Licensee or any third party with respect to products or services of Licensee, or (b) Licensee fully withdraws such claim within ten (10) days after being notified by Licensor. For purposes of this paragraph, “Licensor” and “Licensee” shall also include their respective affiliates.

Licensor disclaims all other warranties, representations, and conditions, whether express, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

Without limiting the generality of the above disclaimer, Licensor makes no representation or warranties that: a) it will prosecute or continue to prosecute, maintain, or defend any patent or patent application, b) it will bring an infringement suit, assert any claim against third parties accused of infringement, or otherwise enforce any patent or patent application, c) it will join as a party to any suit or legal action, d) it will provide Licensee with know-how or assistance necessary or useful to practice the Licensed Patent Rights, e) the Licensed Patent Rights are valid or enforceable, or f) the Licensed Products or Licensed Processes may be exploited or practiced without infringing third party patents.

Licensor shall notify Licensee promptly of any claim of which Licensor is aware and for which Licensor seeks indemnification. Licensee shall have the right to control the defense of such claims, except to the extent that the scope or validity of the Licensed Patent Rights are at issue, in which case Licensor may assume the sole control and defense of such claims at its own expense.

===8.	TRADEMARKS AND ATTRIBUTION===

Licensee agrees to mark Licensed Products and their packaging with patent markings as required by applicable law to preserve Licensor’s rights and otherwise enforce the Licensed Patents. 

At Licensor’s request, Licensee shall reasonably cooperate with Licensor and provide such information as may be necessary for Licensor to prepare use case studies that document Licensee’s use of the Licensed Patent Rights and related usage or impact metrics.  Each party may copy, distribute, and publish such use case studies, including by means of its Web sites, and authorize others to do so, to demonstrate the uses and impact of the technology. 

Except solely as permitted above, neither party may use the other’s trademarks, service marks, trade names, company names, or logos (“Marks”) to offer, market, sell, or otherwise endorse any product or service or to engage in any other trademark usage, unless with the prior written authorization of the owner. Any uses of a party’s Marks shall inure solely to the benefit of that party, along with all goodwill associated therewith.

===9.	GENERAL PROVISIONS===

Notices to the parties shall be provided at the address set forth in the License Data Record, unless a party provides written notice to the other party of a change of address. Notices may be provided by personal delivery, express delivery service, or registered mail. Notices shall be effective on the date received.

Nothing in this Agreement constitutes the parties as partners, joint venturers, principal and agent, or fiduciaries of each other.

A delay or failure in enforcing a right or obligation under this Agreement shall not be construed as an implied waiver of that right or obligation or of any other provision or breach under this Agreement. A waiver under this Agreement is only effective if made in writing and signed by the party granting the waiver.

An amendment or modification of this Agreement is effective only if made in writing and signed by the duly authorized representatives of the parties.

If any provision of this Agreement is deemed to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision, to the extent unenforceable, is severable and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. 

Licensee may not assign any of its rights under this Agreement, delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement, or otherwise transfer this Agreement, without the prior written consent of Licensor, and any attempted assignment, transfer, or delegation shall be voidable by Licensor. Any change of control of Licensee shall be deemed an attempted transfer of this Agreement. Licensor may assign this Agreement in connection with a sale, merger, or transfer of the assets to which this Agreement relates, provided that the assignee assumes all rights and obligations under this Agreement.

Licensee agrees to maintain insurance in amounts prudent for Licensee’s operations and adequate to discharge Licensee’s obligations under Section 7.

This Agreement is governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction set forth in the License Data Record, if any.

If none are specified, then jurisdiction and venue shall be deemed to be in the relevant jurisdiction for Licensor’s address, as stated in the License Data Record.

No rights or forbearances are granted, or may arise (whether through implication, estoppel, exhaustion or otherwise) other than those expressly granted in this Agreement.

EXCEPT FOR THE OBLIGATION TO MAKE PAYMENTS (IF ANY) IN SECTION 3, THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS IN SECTION 7, AND INFRINGEMENT OF ANY TRADEMARK OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT, IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY HAVE ANY LIABILITY OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER TO THE OTHER ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
