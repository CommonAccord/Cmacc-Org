# OneNDA-NDA
A Prose Object version of the https://onenda.club/

There is a new version 7.2 of the oneNDA.  We have put that into ProseObject form.  Provisionally in the /X/Original/ folder as the various components and a Demo as G/OneNDA-NDA/X/Original/2022-v7-2-Demo-Acme-Ang.md.

ToDo, ToDiscuss:

Note that the NDA does not have an Effective Date - a date when it is said to begin.  The start is implied from the signature dates?  

It also does not define "Agreement" though that term is used as if it was a defined term.




README WAS:
OneNDA seems to be thinking in terms of layers - which is close to thinking in "objects".
