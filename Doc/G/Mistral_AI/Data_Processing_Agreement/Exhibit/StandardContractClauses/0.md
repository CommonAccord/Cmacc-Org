Clause.14.2.0.sec=The Parties declare that in providing the warranty in paragraph (a), they have taken due account in particular of the following elements:

Clause.14.2.1.sec=the specific circumstances of the transfer, including the length of the processing chain, the number of actors involved and the transmission channels used; intended onward transfers; the type of recipient; the purpose of processing; the categories and format of the transferred personal data; the economic sector in which the transfer occurs; the storage location of the data transferred;

For Module Three: The {_data_exporter} shall forward the notification to the controller.

Clause.14.6.sec=Following a notification pursuant to paragraph (e), or if the {_data_exporter} otherwise has reason to believe that the {_data_importer} can no longer fulfill its obligations under these {_Clauses}, the {_data_exporter} shall promptly identify appropriate measures (e.g. technical or organisational measures to ensure security and confidentiality) to be adopted by the {_data_exporter} and/or {_data_importer} to address the situation [for Module Three:, if appropriate in consultation with the controller].

Clause.15.1.1.0.sec=The {_data_importer} agrees to notify the {_data_exporter} and, where possible, the data subject promptly (if necessary with the help of the {_data_exporter}) if it:

Clause.15.2.Ti=Review of legality and data minimisation

Clause.15.2.1.sec=The {_data_importer} agrees to review the legality of the request for disclosure, in particular whether it remains within the powers granted to the requesting public authority, and to challenge the request if, after careful assessment, it concludes that there are reasonable grounds to consider that the request is unlawful under the laws of the country of destination, applicable obligations under international law and principles of international comity.

When challenging a request, the {_data_importer} shall seek interim measures with a view to suspending the effects of the request until the competent judicial authority has decided on its merits. It shall not disclose the personal data requested until required to do so under the applicable procedural rules. These requirements are without prejudice to the obligations of the {_data_importer} under Clause 14(e).

Clause.15.2.2.sec=The {_data_importer} agrees to document its legal assessment and any challenge to the request for disclosure and, to the extent permissible under the laws of the country of destination, make the documentation available to the {_data_exporter}.
