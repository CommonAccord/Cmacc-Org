Ti=European Union

Note=The EU is a jurisdiction, but also different than a national jurisdiction.  Should it be classified at the same level, in the same way as a national jurisdiction?

One could reuse the /00 | BE | NL / notion within the EU - as if the Member States were subjurisdictions.  Which in a sense they are, but they are also independent jurisdictions and already present in the folder system.  

A somewhat different question arises with respect to the various languages.  Many EU documents are formally and carefully translated into a variety of languages.  We should use the same language codes, of course.

So, as a first approximation, we will use /EU/00/NL/ for EU documents in Dutch.  We leave open the issue of EU documents that might be both translated and adapted for a particular jurisdiction.  They could be /EU/BE/NL/ for a Dutch language doc adapted to use in Belgium.  But could also be in /BE/00/NL/.  


Now for some substance:

The EU is said to be ground zero for multi-lingual legal.  The same laws, translated into a few dozen languages.

The EU IP Helpdesk has many suggested form documents, notably for use in connection with EU contracts.  They include a Mutual NDA and a One-Way NDA. http://www.iprhelpdesk.eu/node/1107 (Mutual) and http://www.iprhelpdesk.eu/node/1106 (One-Way).   The Mutual NDA is in rough Prose Object form in English and French at http://www.commonaccord.org/index.php?action=list&file=G/EU-IP-HelpDesk/NDA/Mutual/
