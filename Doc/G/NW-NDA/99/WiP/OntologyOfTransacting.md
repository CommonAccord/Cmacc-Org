CodersNote=Agreements involve a number of notions:

1. Persons:

    1. Persons can be "Human" or "Entity".  

        1. Humans can be living, competent (age, mental condition), deceased, unborn, and an almost infinite range of other conditions - e.g. married, divorced, certified (as Dr., lawyer, teacher), a member (of a club, etc.)  There is no general system for assigning unique identities to Humans, and for reasons of security and politics, barriers to having such a systems. 

        1. Entities are, roughly speaking, what the law calls "legal persons", "personnes morales" and the like.  Entities are creatures of law - they "exist" when law says they do and are subject to limitations according to law.  They are, strictly speaking, fictions of law, with many real consequences.  Some Entities are imbued by the law with "personality" (the status of persons) and some are not.  None are imbued with all the rights of Humans.  Some structures, such as "Trusts" have an odd status that splits legal and economic ("equitable") status.  There is a substantial effort to both create a comprehensive global taxonomy of Entities and a global registry providing unique identities for them.  ISO-LEI (See /G/ISO-LEI/).  This can be leveraged for transacting and computability.

        1. Avatars - in some settings Persons have pseudonyms, temporary or limited identities for a particular setting. These probably can be treated as a kind of "Entity."  Indeed, Entities sometimes perform this function.   


    1. Persons can be Parties, or not.  They may be the subject of a contract rather than a Party, for instance when enrolling a student in a Pre-school.  A Person signing on behalf of an Entity is not a Party, nor is the purchasing head authorized to place orders under a contract.  A designated arbitrator is another example of a Person who is not a Party.  Persons have many roles in contracts.  For the roles of Parties, we suggest "Party1" or "P1" but "Buyer" and "Lender" are also permitted. P1, P2, etc. have the advantage of leaving the characterization of the role to the substance of the Agreement.  In the great variety of contracts, the roles are often mixed and certainly varied.  Rather than having an endless variety of role names, it seems better to let the substance of the contract characterize the role.  


1. Places - Geo -  Another dimension of transacting is "where".  Where is relevant in many settings.  It is obviously relevant with respect ot jurisdiction - which legislature, courts, administrators, police have power over events that take place in or touch upon a particular place.  Places have many overlaying ontologies.  Purely spatially, there is the X, Y, Z of Latitude, Longitude and Altitude.  But there are also jurisdictional boundaries, postal addresses, international shipping codes.  Place will sometimes be relative - for instance, this piece of equipment is in shipping container, on a specified ship.

1. Time - When something happened or is to happen is very often important.  Whether a contract was entered into prior to marriage or after divorce, whether the delivery or payment was on time or late.  Time can be handled informally by writing dates and times, it can also often emerge from the date-stamps on records.  In a high-volume production graph, it may be useful to have a notion of time objects.  Each time relevant to a transaction is referenced by a unique identifier whose relationship to other events can be handled more efficiently by the automation system. For current purposes, we will rely on expressing time in writing, with time-stamps as backup.

1. Assets.  Assets are things that can be the subject of contracts.  

    1. Things in legal understanding are either tangible or intangible.  Tangible things are generally sorted into "real" and "personal."  Real means relating to real estate - land and rights in land.  Personal tangible mostly inclueds goods - vehicles, food, clothing.  Even these simple categories have boundary issues.  Fruit on a tree is still part of the tree, hence the land, hence "real", but once picked becomes personal property. Once eaten, it ceases to be personal property and if buried in a land fill would eventually return to real estate.

    1. In accounting practice, assets will have different classifications - often based on how reliably they can be valued.

    1. For our purposes, many of the taxonomies for assets will depend on registries.  A contract may concern a vehicle which is subject to registration and titling in a government database.  It may concern a patent - issued or merely filed. A collection of information - for instance a medical study - may be pooled in a research database. A financial bond or equity many be registered on an exchange. Shipping containers may have a global registry. Developing taxonomies for assets with registrations will mostly require only including those taxonomies and interfacing to those databases.

1. Events.  This is a catch-all category.  An event can be a proposal of a contract, a counter-proposal, a signature, the other signature, an order, confirmation, notice of shipping, notice of receipt, notice of claim, resolution of claim, etc.  An even can be the notice to a warehouse to pick an inventory item and package it, notice to the transporter, confirmation that the package was picked up by the transporter, that delivery is expected at a particular time, presentation of the delivery, etc.  Some of these will be in the transacting record, some may be handled outside of the shared system.

1. Paradigms.  For legal purposes, paradigms include forms of legal documents and their components.  Notably, contract agreements and their sections, subsections, annexed, Statements of Work, noticing and the like.  That is the initial focus of Prose Objects.
