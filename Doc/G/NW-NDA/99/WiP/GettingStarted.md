Getting Started:

To participate in the developement of NW-NDA, and in the course/development work of it, we'll do as much as possible via the git repo github.com/CommonAccord/NW-NDA.

**Get a GitHub account**
**Install VS Code and its plugin**
**Clone NW-NDA to your GitHub account**
**Clone your version of NW-NDA into your VS Code app**

To participate fully, you will need to install the app Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/download

Download and install VS Code.  (Tell us if you have any problems.)

Then (please fill this in with your experience) https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github

Then download github.com/CommonAccord/NW-NDA.
(Should we use the github flow of each person cloning into their own account, then downloading from that version?  Yes?)

(I originally encountered a problem (on a new MacMini) of there not being git infrastructure on my machine.  I needed to install Xcode.  Not sure if this was necessary or a confusion.)

Open the repo in VS Code.  Try making a change to a file, save it.  Click on the little "graph" (circles connected by lines) icon.  Add the modified file to the commit list (click on the + sign to move it into the commit pack, then write a short message, and commit.)

Do a pull-request.
(Need to work through the pull-request cycle - since others will not have authority to directly commit.)

**To be able to render your work locally, you will need a local webserver running Cmacc-Org or similar**
