Visual Studio Code:

I'm writing and managing using only VSCode and finding it works well for me.  I suggest we test whether this works for everyone else.  

The basic editing is fine, excellent. 

The basic file navigation is also fine, excellent. 

I write this in one pane on the right and have a list of all the other file in the left bar.  All the other files I've opened are along the top. 

One thing I can't find is a "back" button.  For example, I've done some editing, think of something that needs to be done to another file, finish that then want to resume with the prior bit of work. 

The collaboration flow seems fine, too, though it needs testing.  I work, commit, push/pull.  The other person does the same, makes a pull-request.  

We also need to play with pyramids of collaboration.  Presumably, these can be done as pyramids of cloning/forking/branches.
