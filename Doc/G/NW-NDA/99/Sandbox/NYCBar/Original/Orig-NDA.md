2.Ti=Confidentiality, Use and Disclosure of Evaluation Material.

Buyer shall be liable for any breaches of this Agreement by its Representatives, except for breaches committed by any Representative that is party to either (a) a separate joinder agreement in the form set forth as Exhibit C hereto or (b) a separate mutually acceptable confidentiality agreement between such Representative and the Company with respect to the Evaluation Material.

2.3.Ti=(c) Compulsory Disclosure.

2.3.1.sec=(i) If Buyer or any of its Representatives or the Company or any of its Representatives (in the case of Discussions Disclosure) is requested or required by interrogatories, requests for information from a governmental, regulatory or supervisory authority, deposition, subpoena or similar legal process to disclose any Evaluation Material or Discussions Disclosure, or disclosure of Evaluation Material or Discussions Disclosure is required [based on the advice of counsel]{FtNt.14} for Buyer or any of its Representatives or the Company or any of its Representatives in order not to be in violation of any applicable law, regulation, order or other similar requirement of any governmental, regulatory or supervisory authority or any applicable listing agreement (collectively, “Applicable Law” and such required disclosing party, the “Compulsory Disclosing Party”), the Compulsory Disclosing Party shall provide the other party with prompt prior written notice thereof, to the extent not prohibited by Applicable Law, so that the other party may seek an appropriate protective order and/or, in the sole discretion of the other party, waive compliance by the Compulsory Disclosing Party with the applicable provisions of this Agreement.

2.3.2.sec=(ii) If, in the absence of such a protective order or waiver, the Compulsory Disclosing Party is nonetheless legally compelled to disclose any Evaluation Material or Discussions Disclosure [based on the advice of counsel], then the Compulsory Disclosing Party may, without liability under this Agreement, disclose only such portion of the Evaluation Material or make only such Discussions Disclosure as is legally required to be disclosed [based on the advice of counsel]; provided that the Compulsory Disclosing Party agrees to use reasonable efforts, at the other party’s expense, to obtain assurances that any such disclosed Evaluation Material and Discussions Disclosure will be afforded confidential treatment.

2.3.3.sec=(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, none of Buyer or any of its Representatives shall be permitted to make any disclosure of Evaluation Material or Discussions Disclosure if Buyer or any of its Representatives has, without the prior written consent of the Company’s board of directors, initiated any proxy contest, tender offer, other effort to enter into a business combination with the Company, or any plan or proposal described in Item 4 of Schedule 13D, or taken any other action in violation of Section 8, that would reasonably be expected to trigger such requirement of disclosure.{FtNt.15}

2.3.4.sec=(iv) The Company acknowledges that Buyer has advised the Company that [Buyer is, and] certain of its Representatives may be, registered investment advisers or regulated financial institutions and thus subject to routine examinations, investigations, regulatory sweeps or other regulatory inquiries. Buyer and its Representatives shall not be required to comply with the process described in paragraphs (i) and (ii) above in respect of disclosures made to a regulatory agency, self-regulatory organization, governmental agency or examiner thereof in the course of any such routine examinations, investigations, sweeps or inquiries, and any such disclosure shall be permitted.

Note=Optional

3.Ti=Securities Law Restrictions

FtNt.16

Nothing herein shall constitute an admission by either party that any Evaluation Material or other such information in fact contains material non-public information concerning the Company or any of its Affiliates.

FtNt.17

4.Ti=No Representations or Warranties

4.sec=Buyer acknowledges and agrees that: (a) no representation or warranty, express or implied, is made by the Company or any of its Representatives as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the Evaluation Material; and (b) Buyer shall be entitled to rely only on those representations and warranties that are expressly set forth in any definitive written agreement that is hereafter executed and delivered by both Buyer or its Affiliate and the Company in connection with the Transaction (a “Definitive Transaction Agreement”). Except as may be expressly set forth in a Definitive Transaction Agreement, none of the Company or any of its Representatives shall have any liability to Buyer or any of its Representatives on account of the use of any Evaluation Material by Buyer or any of its Representatives or any inaccuracy therein or omission therefrom.

5.Ti=Destruction or Erasure of Evaluation Material

5.sec=At any time upon the Company’s written request (including by email), Buyer agrees that Buyer and its Representatives shall promptly destroy or erase all Evaluation Material (including any Evaluation Material held electronically) in the possession or control of Buyer or any of its Representatives, and Buyer shall, if requested in writing (including by email) by the Company, certify such destruction or erasure to the Company; provided that (a) neither Buyer nor any of its Representatives shall be required to destroy or erase any electronic copy of any Evaluation Material that is created pursuant to such Person’s standard electronic backup and archival procedures if (x) personnel whose functions are not primarily information technology in nature do not have access to such retained copies and (y) personnel whose functions are primarily information technology in nature have access to such copies only as reasonably necessary for the performance of their information technology duties (e.g., for purposes of system recovery) and [(b) Buyer and its Representatives may each retain (i) one copy of any Evaluation Material to the extent required to defend or maintain any litigation relating to this Agreement or the Evaluation Material, or to comply with its established document retention policies and (ii) such copies of the Evaluation Material to the extent required to comply with requirements of Applicable Law.]{FtNt.18} All such Evaluation Material retained in accordance with the foregoing proviso shall continue to be subject to Section 2 [for so long as any Evaluation Material is so retained].

FtNt.19

6.Ti=Communications Regarding the Transaction

6.sec=Buyer agrees that all communications by it or any of its Representatives with the other Party concerning the Transaction and its due diligence investigation (including requests for additional Evaluation Material, meetings with management and site visits) shall be directed solely to [___________________], except as may otherwise be approved in advance and in writing (including by email) by the Company. Buyer agrees that neither Buyer nor any of its Representatives will contact or communicate with any of the directors, officers, employees, customers, suppliers, distributors, licensees, licensors and clients of the Company, and other persons, including governmental agencies, having business relations with the Company, regarding the Company or the Transaction, in each case except to the extent such contacts and communications are (i) made in the ordinary course of business of Buyer or the applicable Representatives and are unrelated to the Transaction and the evaluation of the Transaction conducted by Buyer and its Representatives or (ii) approved in advance and in writing (including by email) by the Company.

FtNt.20

Note=Optional

7.Ti=No Solicitation or Hiring

7.sec=Buyer agrees that, except with the prior written consent of the Company, it will not, and it will not permit any of its controlled Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment or hire any [employees/officers/senior management of the Company [first introduced to Buyer or any of its controlled Affiliates in connection with the evaluation of the Transaction][that first become known to Buyer or any of its controlled Affiliates in connection with Buyer’s evaluation of the Transaction][listed on Exhibit A] for a period of [___] year[s] after the date of this Agreement; provided that this Section 7 shall not restrict Buyer or any of its controlled Affiliates from (i) making any general solicitation for employment that is not specifically directed at any such Persons, including through use of a recruiting website or employment search firm (so long as the firm is not instructed to solicit such Persons) or from hiring any Person as a result thereof or (ii) soliciting or hiring any such Person who [has left the employment of the Company][was terminated by the Company] at least [___] months prior to such solicitation or being hired.{FtNt.21} that the information becomes stale and the receiving party does not want lingering contractual obligations. In that case, the bracketed language would be replaced with: “during the term of this Agreement.”

8.Ti=Standstill

8.0.sec=Unless approved in advance in writing by the board of directors of the Company, Buyer agrees that neither Buyer nor any of its Representatives acting on behalf of or in concert with Buyer in this regard will, for a period of [___] year[s] after the date of this Agreement (the “Standstill Period”){FtNt.22}, directly or indirectly:

8.1.0.sec=(a) make any statement or proposal to the board of directors of the Company, any of the Company’s Representatives or any of the Company’s stockholders regarding, or make any public announcement, proposal or offer (including any “solicitation” of “proxies” as such terms are defined or used in Regulation 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) with respect to, or otherwise solicit, seek or offer to effect (including, for the avoidance of doubt, indirectly by means of communication with the press or media)

8.1.4.sec=(iv) any proposal to seek representation on the board of directors of the Company or otherwise control or influence the management, board of directors or policies of the Company, 

8.1.5.sec=(v) any request or proposal to waive, terminate or amend the provisions of this Agreement or

FtNt.24

8.1.6.sec=(vi) any proposal, arrangement or other statement that is inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, including this Section 8(a);

8.1.=[G/Z/para/s6]

8.2.sec=(b) instigate, encourage or assist any third party (including forming a “group” (as such term is used under the Exchange Act) with any such third party) to do, or enter into any discussions or agreements with any third party with respect to, any of the actions set forth in clause (a) above; or

8.3.sec=(c) take any action which would reasonably be expected to require the Company or any of its Affiliates to make a public announcement regarding any of the actions set forth in clause (a) above. [As of the date of this Agreement, the amount of [TYPE OF SECURITIES/LOANS] of the Company beneficially owned by Buyer and each of its Affiliates is as set forth opposite the name of such Person under the heading “Amount Beneficially Owned” [with respect to each such [security] [loan] on Exhibit B.]

Note=Optional

8.4.0.sec=(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 8:

8.4.1.sec=(i) the restrictions set forth in this Section 8 shall terminate and be of no further force and effect if the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or publicly announces that it plans to enter into, or otherwise has recommended that the Company’s stockholders accept or approve, a transaction involving the acquisition by any Person or “group” of beneficial ownership of all or a controlling portion of the Company’s equity securities or all or substantially all of the Companies’ assets (whether by merger, consolidation, business combination, tender or exchange offer, recapitalization, restructuring, sale, equity issuance or otherwise);]

Note="]" at the end of 8.4.1.sec seems a mistake in the original.

FtNt.25

8.4.2.sec=(ii) nothing in this Section 8 shall restrict Buyer or any of its Representatives from making any proposal regarding a possible Transaction directly to the board of directors of the Company on a confidential basis if such proposal does not require the Company to make a public announcement regarding this Agreement, a possible Transaction or any of the matters described in this Section 8; and

8.4.3.sec=(iii) Buyer and its Representatives may purchase goods or services of the Company or submit proposals for the purchase or sale of goods or services to or otherwise deal with the Company in the ordinary course of business.

8.4.=[G/Z/ol-i/s3]

8.=[G/Z/ol-a/s4]

[In the event of any legal proceedings for the enforcement of this Agreement, the reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the prevailing party and its Representatives as determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction in connection with such proceedings, including attorney fees and disbursements, shall be reimbursed by the non-prevailing party.]

10.Ti=No Waiver of Privilege

10.sec=To the extent that any Evaluation Material includes materials subject to the attorney-client privilege, such disclosure is inadvertent and the Company is not waiving, and shall not be deemed to have waived or diminished, its attorney workproduct protections, attorney-client privileges or similar protections and privileges as a result of disclosing any Evaluation Material (including Evaluation Material related to pending or threatened litigation) to Buyer or any of its Representatives.

11.Ti=Residual Knowledge

11.sec=The parties acknowledge and agree that Representatives of Buyer who have received or have been exposed to Evaluation Material may further develop their general knowledge, skills and experience (including general ideas, concepts, knowhow and techniques), which may be based in whole or in part on such Evaluation Material. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the subsequent use by such Representative of such general knowledge, skills and experience, as retained in their unaided memories, will not in itself constitute a breach of this Agreement.

FtNt.27

12.Ti=Term

12.sec=Except for Sections 13(i) (Governing Law; Forum), 13(j) (WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL) and 13(k) (Conflict Waiver), which shall be binding in perpetuity or until the latest date permitted by Applicable Law, [the last sentence of Section 5]{FtNt.28} and Sections 7 and 8 which shall survive in accordance with their respective terms, this Agreement shall expire upon the date that is [___] year[s] after the date of this Agreement.
