README.md

This repo is developed for an online course of mixed computer science and law students.  It takes Non-Disclosure Agreements as a use-case for contracting.  It tests a number of theses:

1. Can we organize a law/CS course via git?

1. Is git (and GitHub) as good a platform for legal collaboration as it is for code collaboration?

1. Is VS Code a ready-made interface for legal work? 

1. Are "Prose Objects" an ideal form of legal "source" ?

1. What are the barriers to easier, better use of "Prose Objects"?  How do they fit into an ecosystem of contracting, governance, Smart Contracts, AI/ML/NLP processing?

1. Can NDAs be "codified" globally?

1. Will front-line users of NDAs - corporate counsel, businesses and others - appreciate and adopt codification.

1. Will we ever run out of questions?


The repo is at <a href="https://github.com/CommonAccord/NW-NDA">https://github.com/CommonAccord/NW-NDA</a>

It is presented at <a href="http://www.commonaccord.org/i.php?v=l&f=G/NW-NDA/">http://www.commonaccord.org/i.php?v=l&f=G/NW-NDA/</a>


Materials about the process and the course are at /99/.

To get up to speed, it is highly recommended to get the application Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and clone a copy of this NW-NDA repo into VS Code.  VS Code greatly eases reading and navigation, as well as providing a way to edit and contribute.  Think of it as a browser.

We will link to some featured work here.
