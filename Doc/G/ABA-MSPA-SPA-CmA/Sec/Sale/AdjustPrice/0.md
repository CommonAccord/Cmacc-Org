If the {_Closing_Date_Shareholders'_Equity} is less than the {_Interim_Shareholders'_Equity}, the {_Adjustment_Amount} shall be paid by {_Sellers} to <a href="#SPA.Def.Buyer.Def" class="definedterm">Buyer</a>.  If the {_Closing_Date_Shareholders'_Equity} is greater than the {_Interim_Shareholders'_Equity}, subject to {Claim.Setoff.Xref}, the {_Adjustment_Amount} shall be paid by <a href="#SPA.Def.Buyer.Def" class="definedterm">Buyer</a> to {_Sellers}.

Interest.sec=All payments under this {Sale.AdjustPrice.Xref} shall be made together with interest at the rate set forth in the {_Promissory_Notes}, which interest will begin accruing on the {_Closing_Date} and end on the day before the payment is made.  Within three (3) {_Business_Days} after the {_Closing_Balance_Sheet} and {_Adjustment_Amount} become binding on the parties pursuant to {Sale.AdjustProcedure.Xref}, {_Sellers} or <a href="#SPA.Def.Buyer.Def" class="definedterm">Buyer</a>, as the case may be, shall make the payment provided for in this {Sale.AdjustPrice.Xref}.
