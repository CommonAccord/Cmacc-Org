Ti=Adjust Amount and Payment

Calculate.sec=The "{_Adjustment_Amount}" will be the difference, if any, between (i) the consolidated shareholders' equity of the <a href="#SPA.Def.Company.Def" class="definedterm">Company</a> and its {_Subsidiaries}  as of the {_Closing_Date}, as shown on the {_Closing_Balance_Sheet} (the "{_Closing_Date_Shareholders'_Equity}"), and (ii) {InterimBalanceSheet.ShareholdersEquity.Sum.$} (the consolidated shareholders' equity of the <a href="#SPA.Def.Company.Def" class="definedterm">Company</a> and its {_Subsidiaries} as shown on the {_Interim_Balance_Sheet}) (the "{_Interim_Shareholders'_Equity}").  If the {_Closing_Date_Shareholders'_Equity} is less than the {_Interim_Shareholders'_Equity}, the {_Adjustment_Amount} shall be paid by {_Sellers} to <a href="#SPA.Def.Buyer.Def" class="definedterm">Buyer</a>.  If the {_Closing_Date_Shareholders'_Equity} is greater than the {_Interim_Shareholders'_Equity}, subject to {Claim.Setoff.Xref}, the {_Adjustment_Amount} shall be paid by <a href="#SPA.Def.Buyer.Def" class="definedterm">Buyer</a> to {_Sellers}.

Pay.sec=If the {_Adjustment_Amount} or, after giving effect to {Claim.Setoff.Xref}, any portion of the {_Adjustment_Amount} is to be paid by <a href="#SPA.Def.Buyer.Def" class="definedterm">Buyer</a> to {_Sellers}, the {_Adjustment_Amount} or such portion thereof shall be paid by <a href="#SPA.Def.Buyer.Def" class="definedterm">Buyer</a> by wire transfer to {_Sellers'_Representative} pursuant to wire transfer instructions provided to <a href="#SPA.Def.Buyer.Def" class="definedterm">Buyer</a> by {_Sellers'_Representative} prior to the due date for the payment set forth in {Sale.AdjustPrice.Interest.Xref}.  If the {_Adjustment_Amount} is to be paid by {_Sellers} to <a href="#SPA.Def.Buyer.Def" class="definedterm">Buyer</a>, the {_Adjustment_Amount} shall be paid by {_Sellers} by wire transfer to <a href="#SPA.Def.Buyer.Def" class="definedterm">Buyer</a> pursuant to wire transfer instructions provided by <a href="#SPA.Def.Buyer.Def" class="definedterm">Buyer</a> to {_Sellers'_Representative} prior to the due date for the payment set forth in {Sale.AdjustPrice.Interest.Xref}.

Interest.sec=All payments under this {Sale.AdjustPrice.Xref} shall be made together with interest at the rate set forth in the {_Promissory_Notes}, which interest will begin accruing on the {_Closing_Date} and end on the day before the payment is made.  Within three (3) {_Business_Days} after the {_Closing_Balance_Sheet} and {_Adjustment_Amount} become binding on the parties pursuant to {Sale.AdjustProcedure.Xref}, {_Sellers} or <a href="#SPA.Def.Buyer.Def" class="definedterm">Buyer</a>, as the case may be, shall make the payment provided for in this {Sale.AdjustPrice.Xref}.
