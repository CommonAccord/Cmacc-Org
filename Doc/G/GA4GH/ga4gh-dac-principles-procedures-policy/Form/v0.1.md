Ti=Global Alliance for Genomics and Health: Data Access Committee Guiding Principles and Procedural Standards Policy

LawyersNote="Policy" is used as a defined term, but is not formally defined.  I've done it informally. (Not official.) "DURI" is defined, but not used. "DUO" and "REWS" are each defined twice in the document (consistently, but still ...).  "DAA" is defined but not used.

Intro.Ti=Preamble

Intro.1.sec=This document is the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health's ({Def.GA4GH}'s) Data Access Committee Guiding Principles and Procedural Standards {Def.Policy}, produced by the {_GA4GH}'s Data Access Review Standards ({Def.DACReS}) working group. It builds on the mission of the {_GA4GH} and provides greater direction for the interpretation of the {_GA4GH} Framework for Responsible Sharing of Genomic and Health-Related Data (the '{Def.Framework}'). It seeks to complement the ongoing work in the {_GA4GH}'s Regulatory and Ethics Work Stream ({Def.REWS}) and Data Use & Researcher Identities ({Def.DURI}) Work Stream on facilitating responsible sharing of genomic and associated data through the development of harmonized standards and a data use ontology.

Intro.2.sec=Both inappropriately restrictive and overly permissive policies governing access to genomic and associated data challenge underlying principles of research ethics. The former can prevent persons from accessing data that meaningfully advances research. The latter can place the privacy and confidentiality interests of participants/data subjects at increased risk and erode public trust in research. Data access committees ({Def.DAC}s) represent one institutional safeguard charged with applying rules meant to ensure an ethically permissible balance between data protection and accessibility. There are, however, no procedural standards that apply across {_DACs}. The absence of such standards can invite inconsistencies in {_DAC} reviews, compromising their quality and effectiveness. Conversely, standardizing {_DAC} processes can foster trust and mutual recognition, paving the way to greater coordination, collaboration, and delegation between {_DACs} and other oversight bodies that improves the efficiency of data access without sacrificing protection. 

Intro.3.sec=For the purpose of this {_Policy}, a {_DAC} is defined as a body comprised of one or more members who are responsible for overseeing access to genomic and associated data for research subsequent to the primary purpose for which the data were collected, where requested by internal and external applicants to one or more repositories. {_DACs} may oversee multiple distinct datasets or repositories. They may govern access by researchers within a particular institution, as well as external requestors from other institutions, sectors, or countries. {_DACs} may grant direct access to datasets sent digitally in secure form to data users or that are stored in secure computing environments (e.g. a data safe haven). {_DAC}S may also grant indirect access to data (i.e. model-to-data where data users submit algorithms to run on secure data sets that remain hidden).

Context.Ti=Context

Context.Purpose.Ti=Purpose of this {_Policy}

Context.Purpose.sec=Supplementing the {_Framework}, the purpose of this {_Policy} is to outline guiding principles and provide procedural standards for {_DACs}. Where applicable, the procedural standards are categorized as either 'essential' or 'desired.' Operationalizing these guiding principles and procedural standards should engender greater trust in the {_DAC} review process across institutions, repositories, and jurisdictions and thereby promote more efficient, more secure, and more consistent procedures for access to data.

Context.Purpose.=[G/Z/Base]

Context.Resource.Ti=Resources

Context.Resource.sec=The {_GA4GH} has developed tools and resources to support its Policies. They are designed in accordance with the Foundational Principles of the {_Framework}. The latest tools and resources developed by the {_GA4GH} are available on its <a href='https://www.ga4gh.org/genomic-data-toolkit/regulatory-ethics-toolkit/'>website</a>. 

Context.Resource.=[G/Z/Base]

Context.Complexity.Ti=Recognizing differences

Context.Complexity.sec=Differences in the content or application of ethics principles, policies, or norms arise locally among institutions, repositories, and jurisdictions but are not insurmountable barriers to achieving harmonized guiding principles and procedural standards for {_DACs}. This {_Policy} aims to provide baseline or 'essential' standards that all {_DACs} should endeavor to apply, as well as additional 'desired' standards that {_DACs} may adopt as contextually relevant.

PrinProc.Ti=Guiding Principles and Procedural Standards 

PrinProc.Intro.1.sec=The following Guiding Principles and Procedural Standards are intended to complement and build upon existing laws, regulations, guidelines, and practices. They are not intended to supersede any human rights instruments or national laws and regulations. Across institutions, repositories, and jurisdictions, {_DACs} and managing organizations of {_DACs} should work together to implement these Guiding Principles and Procedural Safeguards.

PrinProc.Intro.2.sec=One or more of the Procedural Standards in this {_Policy} may fall under the responsibility of the {_DAC} and/or the host data repository and/or their managing organization, as per the applicable governance arrangements, terms of reference, and management structure. 

PrinProc.Intro.=[G/Z/paras/s2]

Principle.Ti=Guiding Principles 

PrinProc.GuidingPrinciple..1.Ti=Guiding Principles 

PrinProc.GuidingPrinciple..0.sec=The Guiding Principles of this {_Policy} address the responsible oversight of access to genomic and associated data for research subsequent to the primary purpose for which the data were collected. They also facilitate compliance with the obligations and norms set by international and national laws and policies to: 

PrinProc.GuidingPrinciple..1.sec=Make data accessible to advance research and scientific knowledge, as well as to improve health outcomes, through responsible oversight practices;  

PrinProc.GuidingPrinciple..2.sec=Promote health, wellbeing, and the fair distribution of expected benefits, as well as protect against risks;

PrinProc.GuidingPrinciple..3.sec=Respect the reasonable expectations of data producers and research participants/data subjects, and the communities to which participants/data subjects belong; and

PrinProc.GuidingPrinciple..4.sec=Maintain procedural fairness for applicants seeking access to data.

PrinProc.GuidingPrinciple..=[G/Z/ol-i/s4]

Procedure.Ti=Procedural Standards 

PrinProc.Purpose.Ti=Purpose 

PrinProc.Purpose.1.sec=The primary purpose of a {_DAC} is to oversee access to genomic and associated data for research subsequent to the primary purpose for which the data were collected, where requested by internal and external applicants to one or more repositories, and to assure responsible data use. Such data may identify individual research participants/data subjects. {_DACs} often make decisions on access requests and oversee the management and administration of data access. {_DAC} roles include ensuring that data users who are granted access to the data comply with the terms of a Data Access Agreement ({Def.DAA}){_FtNt1} and to use the data only in approved ways.

PrinProc.Purpose.2.sec=Secondary purposes of {_DACs} include verifying an applicant's identity and affiliation; adhering to the terms of participant consent; determining if the requested data uses are relevant and appropriate to the applicant's proposed research project; ensuring responsible downstream data uses; and complying with applicable legal, regulatory, and data protection provisions.{_FtNt2}

PrinProc.Purpose.3.sec=As distinct from a research ethics committee or institutional review board, which assesses the full range of ethical issues associated with a research project involving humans before it begins, the purpose of a {_DAC} is typically to assess if the proposed use of the data is within the bounds of the data's permitted uses and to vet applicant qualifications.

PrinProc.Purpose.4.sec=It is possible that {_DACs} also oversee access to biospecimens.

PrinProc.Purpose.5.sec={_DACs} are normally established by the host data repository and/or their managing organization to evaluate the merit and feasibility of secondary/ancillary research projects that are proposed to make use of the data.

PrinProc.Purpose.6.sec=Each {_DAC} should clearly state its purpose(s) in its own Terms of Reference (see below), as suitable for the context in which the {_DAC} operates.

PrinProc.Purpose.=[G/Z/ol-i/s6]

PrinProc.Transparency.Ti=Transparency 

PrinProc.Transparency.1.sec=As outlined in the {_GA4GH} <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-1ZdMyrdQEYM0byyJaIJSQG8gBCQgkgI/view'>Ethics Review Recognition Policy</a>, which applies to research ethics committees, this {_Policy} also recognizes that transparency ought to serve as a standard that drives committee work in the genomic and health-related data context. For {_DACs}, this includes transparency in both the application process to request data access and in the criteria/access conditions that underpin the {_DAC}'s decisions, as well as in the ethics approvals for the data access it oversees.

PrinProc.Transparency.2.sec=The {_DAC}'s host data repository and/or their managing organization should provide transparent mechanisms for an applicant to apply for data access. This includes providing clear, publicly accessible information about the terms of access (i.e. how applicants who may wish to use the data should seek access), the criteria by which requests for data access are assessed, as well as contact details for applicants who may wish to find out more about the data available for access.

PrinProc.Transparency.3.sec=The {_DAC}'s host data repository and/or their managing organization should provide a clear, publicly accessible statement about ethics approvals, if applicable, for the data access arrangements in place.

PrinProc.Transparency.4.sec=Information about approved access requests, including short summaries in plain language of the research purposes (which may be the responsibility of the data users as part of the application process) and the principal data user(s), should be made publicly available on the {_DAC} or the host data repository's website.

PrinProc.Transparency.5.sec=If feasible, the permitted purposes for subsequent research projects, including associated limits and conditions should be described for all resources hosted within a repository (data or biospecimens) using a common ontology e.g. {_GA4GH} <a href='https://github.com/EBISPOT/DUO'>Data Use Ontology ({Def.DUO})</a>. This will allow for semantic tagging of datasets with usage restrictions, which can help interpret the conditions in a transparent, consistent, and structured manner.

PrinProc.Transparency.=[G/Z/ol-i/s5]

PrinProc.TermOfReference.Ti=Terms of Reference 

PrinProc.TermOfReference.0.1.sec=A {_DAC} should establish and communicate Terms of Reference in codified form to define its purpose, scope and structure, and its roles and responsibilities. The Terms of Reference ought to provide a documented basis for making decisions and for confirming or developing a common understanding of the scope among the {_DAC} members. Such terms should reflect local circumstances (e.g. different models of access) and key aspects of membership, whether a single member or small/large committee structure.
