<b>Note/Updates</b>=The following are suggestions - from most recent to oldest.

1.5.Sen={m-}{1.5.BP001.Sen}{-m}

1.5.BP001.Sen=Although our DNA is very similar to each other, your genomic data is entirely unique.

Note/1.5.BP001.Sen=(1) Under pt 2 ("purpose") I would suggest replacing "Although our DNA is very similar to each other,..." by "Although all human DNA is similar..." (otherwise it may not be entirely clear what "our" refers to)

Note/Base=This is from the Form, as published. 

Ti=Purpose

Ti=What is the purpose of this research?

1.1.Sen=Genes are the basic "instruction book" for the cells that make up our bodies.

1.2.Sen=All genes are made of DNA.

1.3.Sen=The DNA of a person is more than 99% the same as the DNA of any other person, but no two people have exactly 100% the same DNA except for identical twins.

1.4.Sen=The complete set of DNA in your body, including all its genes, is called your genome.

1.5.Sen=Although our DNA is very similar to each other, your genomic data is entirely unique.

1.6.Sen=Variations in the genome explain some of the physical differences between people, and partly explain why some develop diseases like cancer, diabetes, asthma, and depression, while others do not.

1.7.Sen=At present, it is generally not possible to predict which changes in DNA lead to disease or health.

2.1.Sec=We have also found important differences in DNA between population groups.

2.2.Sec=Only by comparing your DNA and medical data with that of other people can we identify patterns and relationships in the genes, together with the environment, to help us better understand health and disease.

2.3.Sec=Thus, the purpose of the {m-}{Study.Name.Full}{-m} is to {m-}{Study.Description}{-m}. 

3.sec=This is research, and not medical care. You should see a physician for any health problems or medical questions you might have.
