JTW.for research purposes=<b>{BMK.001}</b>

BMK.001=for biomedical research purposes

Note/BMK.001=I always put��."with commercial entities for biomedical research purposes".
(This allows  such entities to do basic research as well e.g. comparative biology for vaccines etc)

BP.001=health-related research purposes

Note/BP.001=Given that for many research participants it is important to know whether the research will have health-benefits for other people, should we say "health-related research purposes" here, instead of merely "research purposes", which, in theory, could include market research etc?

BP.002=for any purposes, including non-health related purposes

Note/BP.002=could be amended slightly to read "... will be allowed with commercial parties for any purposes, including non-health related purposes"? I know this is slightly redundant, but a bit of redundancy often helps to convey meaning.
