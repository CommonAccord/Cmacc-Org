NDA based originally on a CooleyGo form (with permission but without endorsement). It has been significantly modified.

The sections (in /Sec/) have common-sense names.  There are a number of alternative provisions that show some ways to create and share alternatives. 

This repo is also mounted as part of commonaccord.org - with demos of completed NDAs at <a href="http://commonaccord.org/i.php?v=l&f=G/Agt-NDA-CmA/Demo/">http://commonaccord.org/i.php?v=l&f=G/Agt-NDA-CmA/Demo/</a>.
