Dear scholar, 

This is an opportunity to make your own course. Specifically, independent studies are an academically rigorous way to learn about specific interests otherwise not offered at Brown. This is a unique chance to pursue your passions, work closely with interesting people, and create something of your own. 

This application form is for Group Independent Study Projects (GISP), Independent Study Projects (ISP), and Academic Internships (AI). In total the application takes about 10 to 12 hours to complete. The deadline for proposed spring courses is the second Friday of November, and the second Friday of April for fall courses. 

There are six sections in this application. Each section has a short breakdown in blue text and example text in italicized font. Please delete the italicized parts as you go, but leave in the blue text. The blue text text will be helpful as you re-edit your document, and helpful to us when we give you feedback later. 


0.0.sec=Before you begin, the following is mandatory:

0.1.sec=Schedule an appointment with an Independent Study coordinator at the CRC. Come with an idea or a very basic outline of your course. This will boost your chances of creating a successful application. 
To schedule an appointment email independent_study@brown.edu.
Applications without a coordinator meeting will not be considered. 

0.2.sec=Read the Independent Study FAQs found here. 

Submission Instructions
Please send your application as a Word Document to independent_study@brown.edu. Title your document Title_Semester/Year. For example, TransgenderStudies_Fall2017. Your submission should include a) your application, including the faculty statement, and b) supplemental material, if needed. 

Good luck! And may the independent study force be with you. 
And as always, please reach out (email above) with any questions. 

With care, 
Your GISP Coordinators & CRC Director
(revised Fall 2017)

1.Ti=What 

Please explain your course/AI by addressing the following (500 words max): 
First paragraph: 
1.1.1.sec={Purpose of your course} 

1.1.2.sec={Guiding questions}

1.1.3.sec={Goals of course} 

1.1.=[G/Z/para/s3]

Second paragraph: 

What is the scholarly context of your course (how is it studied elsewhere)? 

1.2.1.sec={ScholarlyContext}

What themes or topics will you examine, and how will you do so week to week? 

1.2.2.sec={TopicsWeeklySchedule}

1.2.=[G/Z/para/s2]

Third paragraph: 

What is the structure of your course (hours, assignments, midterm/ final, etc.)? 

1.3.sec={CourseStructure}

1.=[G/Z/paras/s3]

Use the following example as a guide: 

The purpose of this independent study is to ask how people have used art to care for others. What is
care? What is art? Can art be a way of caring for other people? If so, how does the giving of care through
art play out in the real world? How has it succeeded and failed, for example in bettering people’s
material and political conditions? How has it offered people sources of strength when change is not
possible? Our goal is to develop our own answers to these questions. We will explore how art does and
does not constitute a form of care through the literary arts (poetry, literature), film, and music. 

Our scholarly context is not a specific academic field, but a conglomerate of thinkers and art makers
who are concerned with the question of how art does and does not “work” as a way to care for others.
We look at American traditions of art inspired by the Romantics (for example, the poetry of Emily
Dickinson). We will explore the politically radical aesthetic theories these western traditions gave way
to—thinkers like John Dewey, Walter Benjamin and Simone Weil. We will examine how this art evolved
into our contemporary context, looking particularly at artists who simultaneously participate in and
refuse the western tradition, such as Kendrick Lamar and Young Thug, whose work is seen by millions
and emerges from contexts of black communal struggle and black living. We will extend our inquiry to
art across the globe, particularly looking at contemporary cinema and aesthetic theory in the Middle
East that responds to American Settler Colonialism abroad. Through this complement of sources, we will
address specific topics including how art can be a way of caring (A) for the self (B) for a relationship (C)
for community (D) for political struggle, and (E) for a spiritual or religious calling.

This independent study will explore these questions through papers, weekly readings, written
responses, and meetings with Professor Keach. It will require, in total, about 205 hours of time. Weekly
3 meetings will be thirty minutes to an hour (7.5-15 hours total). I will spend two hours a week on written
responses which put the text’s arguments in conversation with our central questions (30 hours total). I
will email Professor Keach my responses each week. Readings will take 8-10 hours each week (120-150
hours total). At the mid-term of the semester, I will produce a 10-15 page paper (20 hours total). At the
end of the semester, I will produce a thirty to 15-25 page paper on a topic to be chosen in conversation
with Professor Keach (25 hours).

An example of learning goals:

The learning goals of the independent study are:
1) To better understand the interplay between various aspects in society and how the perceptions and realities surrounding healthcare are constructed.
2) To consider historical precedents and factors to create informed predictions about current events and future consequences relevant to healthcare in Cuba.

2.2.2.sec={CourseGap}

2.2.=[G/Z/para/s2]

2.=[G/Z/paras/s2]

Use the following example as a guide: 

Sports analytics is a large and growing field, especially relating to professional athletics. As our world becomes increasingly data driven, the demand for data analytics will also increase. This is why we want to learn this information now. This course is important to us because we want to understand how to apply lessons of game theory, probability, and data science to a real world context. By better understanding the data underpinnings of sports we hope to gain an even greater appreciation for the sports we love.  Additionally, we think that this course will promote data science as a whole at Brown, as sports are a highly accessible way to connect the average student or person with data science and analytics.

Here are two courses that are similar to our proposed course, and how we fill in the knowledge gaps: 
CS1951a Data Science (https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1951-a/assignments/): This course covers explores data cleaning, basic statistics, working with large data sets, machine learning, and visualization. This course doesn’t cover the heavy focus on probability and game theory that we plan to cover in our course, as well as the sport-specific element - what sort of work is currently being done in professional sports? How do we develop metrics? How do we communicate our findings to players and coaches? In addition, data scraping is not taught in the course, which is especially relevant in sports analytics when data may not be readily available.

ECON 1870 Game Theory (http://www.thecriticalreview.org/ECON/1870): This course covers
the functionality of game theory in life and economics. This course does not cover the study of game theory both through current sports practices based off analytics (i.e. Moreyball) and also through group game theory hacking sessions. The advantage of studying game theory through a GISP is we can incorporate more interactive pedagogical techniques - for instance, game theory hacking sessions, and also open-ended game theory discussions (see syllabus). This course also lacks all the data analysis, statistics, and machine learning we plan to cover in our course.








3.Ti=How

3.1.Ti=Evaluation

Please explain how your course will be graded by addressing the following: 

Assignment/class breakdown (percentages) 

3.1.sec={EvaluationPercentageTable}

Assignments should demonstrate a mastery of the material / align with your learning objectives

Explain each course requirement, include percentage, details, due dates 

3.2.Ti=Explanation

3.2.sec={EvaluationExplanation}


Use the following example as a guide: 

Midterm Paper 20%
Final Paper 30%
Participation 25%
Weekly Reading 25%

This course will be graded on class participation, weekly reading responses, and the midterm
and final papers. Class participation will account for 25% of the student’s grade. This will be determined
by attendance and active participation that evinces extensive work outside of class. Weekly reading
responses will also account for 25% of the student’s grade. The student will devote two hours a week to these responses. These will generally be around 500 words, and contain a summary of the arguments from that week’s reading and bring these arguments to bear on the course’s ongoing conversation and
broader themes. A finished midterm paper, due October 15th, will account for 20% of the student’s
grade. An initial draft of the final paper, due December 3rd, will account for 5% of the student’s grade. A
finished final paper, due December 15th, will account for 25% of the student’s grade. Grading will be
done by Professor Keach. 

3.3.Ti=Meeting Times 

Please explain how often your course will meet/ the breakdown of each course:  
[must meet at least 2 hours, 30 minutes per week – ideally align with Brown course scheduling blocks] 
[Faculty sponsors must participate in at least five (GISP) or ten (ISP) weekly meetings]  

3.3.sec={MeetingTimes}

Use the following example: 

Tuesday/ Thursday 1-2:30 [3 hours, 00 min/week] 

Tuesday class will be discussion based. Students will come to class prepared to discuss the reading material for that week. Each week will have an alternating discussion leader. 

Thursday class will be presentation based. Each week a different student will present a topic for the first half of class, followed by a discussion for the second half of class.
