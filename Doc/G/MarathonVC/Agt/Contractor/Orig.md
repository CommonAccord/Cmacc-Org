Doc.Ti=Independent Contractor Agreement

CodersNote=Because some sections of this Contractor Agreement are the same as sections of the Employment Agreement, we will reference those Employment Agreement sections and delete the corresponding text here.  This assures uniformity and focuses improvements.  Many other sections have only minor variations, and could be harmonized and then "refactored."

CoderNote=The Definitions section is somewhat differently constructed than the Employment.

And the Construe sections do not have a separate heading, but continue the list. For simplicity, in the future, these might be harmonized.
