Doc.Ti=Independent Contractor Agreement

CodersNote=Because some sections of this Contractor Agreement are the same as sections of the Employment Agreement, we will reference those Employment Agreement sections and delete the corresponding text here.  This assures uniformity and focuses improvements.  Many other sections have only minor variations, and could be harmonized and then "refactored."  

/UseAgtFrame=This.sec=This Independent Contractor Agreement (the “{Def.Agreement.sec}”) is made as of {EffectiveDate.YMD} by and between the following contracting parties (each a “{_Party}” and together the “{_Parties}”):

/UseAgtFrame=A)[], a [] company incorporated and operating under the laws of Greece, with General Commercial Register nr. [], registered offices at [], Greece, and Tax Identification Number [], being herein duly represented by Mr. [], [] (hereinafter referred to as the “Company”) and

OriginalNote=B)[if natural person] [], father’s name: [], mother’s name: [], date of birth: [], an individual residing at [], Greece, with ID nr. [], Tax Identification Number [],

/=(hereinafter referred to as “Contractor”).

Why.1.sec=WHEREAS {_the_Company} desires to retain {_Contractor} as an independent contractor to perform certain services for {_the_Company} and {_Contractor} is willing to perform such services;

Why.2.sec=WHEREAS {_Contractor} represents and warrants that {_Contractor} possesses the qualifications and skills necessary to perform the services set forth in this {_Agreement};

Why.=[G/Z/paras/s2]

/UseAgtFrame=NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of covenants and agreements contained herein, the {_Parties} agree as follows:

1.Ti=Definitions

CoderNote=The Definitions section is somewhat differently constructed than the Employment. The Consulting Agreement does not include Appointment, Company Affiliate, Term or Trade Secret, so we create a new list of defined terms. And the Construe sections do not have a separate heading, but continue the list. For simplicity, in the future, these might be harmonized.

1.sec=<ol><li>{Def.sec}<li>{Construe.1.sec}<li>{Construe.2.sec}</ol>

Def.=[G/MarathonVC/Agt/Employee/Sec/Def/0.md]

Construe.=[G/MarathonVC/Agt/Employee/Sec/Construe/0.md]

LawyerNote="Intellectual Property Right" is defined but not actually used in the Agreement.  There are a number of occurrences of "intellectual property right" but not capitalized.

Def.sec={Def.0.sec}<ul type="none"><li>{Def.Confidential_Information.sec}<li>{Def.Invention.sec}<li>{Def.Intellectual_Property_Right.sec}<li>{Def.Moral_Right.sec}</ul>

CodersNote=The "Inventions" section in the Employment Agreement is substantially different, so we put the Contractor's form back in, overriding. 

Def.Invention.sec=“{_Inventions}” means discoveries, inventions, works of authorship, concepts, ideas, processes, methods, formulas, compositions, techniques, programs, software, designs, improvements and innovations or “know-how” related thereto (including all data and records pertaining thereto), whether or not patentable, copyrightable, registrable as a trademark, recorded in any medium or reduced to writing.

Such {_Services} may be amended, from time-to-time, by the {_Parties} by written agreement, signed by {_Contractor} and {_the_Company}.

2.7.sec={_Contractor} will, in the performance of {_Contractor}’s duties hereunder, comply with all policies and procedures of {_the_Company} that are applicable to independent contractors and consultants, as communicated to {_Contractor} from time to time. {_The_Company} reserves the right to change such policies and procedures on a prospective basis, at any time, effective upon reasonable notice to {_Contractor}.

2.8.sec={_Contractor} agrees that {_Contractor} will, from time-to-time during the term of this {_Agreement}, keep {_the_Company} informed as to {_Contractor}’s progress in performing the {_Services} hereunder and that {_Contractor} will, as requested by {_the_Company}, prepare written reports with respect thereto.

3.6.sec={_Contractor} shall be responsible for the payment of all taxes on amounts received from {_the_Company} for the {_Services}; provided that {_the_Company} may apply on {_Contractor}’s compensation any applicable withholding tax.
