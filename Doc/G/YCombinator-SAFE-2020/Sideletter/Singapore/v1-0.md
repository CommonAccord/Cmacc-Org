Note=The Singapore version is exactly like the Canadian version except for this difference of vocabulary and ... a change that is not brought forward in this patch.  That change is in the Amendment section, and reads "of a majority of shares of Capital Shares issued ".  That seems a carryover from the US's "shares of ... Stock", and accordingly a mistake.

_Standard_Preferred_Shares={_Standard_Preference_Shares}

_Standard_Preference_Shares=<a href='#Def.Standard_Preferred_Shares.target' class='definedterm'>Standard Preference Shares</a>

Note=No version number on the original, so I used v1-0.md to match the others.
