The DAO and the Contributor agree as follows:


1.Ti=Services

1.sec=The {_Contributor} agrees to consult with and provide such services to the {_DAO} from time to time as are mutually agreed by the parties (the “{Def.Services.Target}”). 


2.Ti=Consideration

2.1.sec=As the sole consideration due to the {_Contributor} for the {_Services}, the {_DAO} will provide such stablecoins or other cryptocurrency or assets as the {_DAO} and {_Contributor} shall separately agree (the “{Def.Payment.Target}”), provided, however, that {_Contributor} acknowledges and agrees that the amount, form and timing of the {_Payment} is subject at all times to modification pursuant to the {_DAO}’s governance framework. In no event shall the {_DAO} be responsible for any fees or other payments to the {_Contributor} except as expressly set forth in this {_Agreement}.

CodersNote=Optional:

3.Ti=Ownership

3.sec=The {_Contributor} shall own all intellectual property and related rights throughout the world that arise in whole or part out of, or in connection with, the {_Services} or any {_Proprietary_Information} (“{Def.Inventions.Target}”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the {_Contributor} shall grant the {_DAO} a free, nonexclusive license to use the Inventions.


4.Ti=Proprietary Information

4.1.sec=The {_Contributor} agrees that all Inventions and other business, technical and financial information (including, without limitation, the identity of and information relating to {_DAO}’s members, contributors or grant applicants) the {_Contributor} obtains from or assigns to the {_DAO}, or learns in connection with the {_Services}, constitute “{Def.Proprietary_Information.Target}.” The {_Contributor} will hold in confidence and not disclose or, except in performing the {_Services} or as otherwise permitted by the {_DAO}, use any {_Proprietary_Information}.

4.2.sec=However, the {_Contributor} shall not be so obligated with respect to information that (i) the {_Contributor} can document is or becomes readily publicly available without restriction through no fault of the {_Contributor}, or (ii) that the {_Contributor} knew without restriction prior to its disclosure by the {_DAO}.

4.3.sec=Upon termination or as otherwise requested by the {_DAO}, the {_Contributor} will promptly return to the {_DAO} all items and copies containing or embodying {_Proprietary_Information}.

4.4.sec=Notwithstanding the foregoing nondisclosure obligations, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 1833(b), the {_Contributor} shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that is made: (1) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney, and solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (2) in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding if such filing is made under seal.

4.=[G/Z/ol/s4]


5.Ti=Termination

5.sec=Either party may terminate this {_Agreement} at any time, for any reason, by giving the other written notice (including email).  Notwithstanding any such termination, Sections {2.Xnum} through {8.Xnum} of this {_Agreement} and any remedies for breach of this {_Agreement} shall survive any termination or expiration.


6.Ti=Relationship of the Parties; Promotional Rights

6.1.sec=Notwithstanding any provision hereof, for all purposes of this {_Agreement}, each party shall be and act as an independent contractor and not as a partner, joint venturer, agent or employee of the other and shall not bind nor attempt to bind the other to any contract.  The {_Contributor} shall not be eligible to participate in any of the {_DAO}’s employee benefit plans, fringe benefit programs, group insurance arrangements or similar programs.

6.2.sec=The {_DAO} may use and authorize the use of the {_Contributor}’s name (as represented to the {_DAO} by the {_Contributor}) in promotional materials, websites and the like. The {_DAO} will confirm in writing with the {_Contributor} should the {_Contributor}’s name be shared “publicly”, publicly defined as available to anybody via the world wide web without any direct sharing or password protections on pages. The {_Contributor} will also follow protocol for online social media posting and sharing that the {_DAO} shares and may update from time to time.

The {_Contributor} agrees that if they witness a violation of the {_Code}, they will report it to an administrator or similar authority designated by the {_DAO}, which may include a registry or other protocol for automating disclosures and dispute resolution ("{Def.Administrators.Target}"). The {_Contributor} further acknowledges that if they do not follow the {_Code}, the {_Administrators} may edit the {_Contributor}’s posts and remove them from the {_DAO} and/or the {_DAO}’s online coordination system(s). Whether to take any enforcement action is in the complete discretion of the {_Administrators}.

8.Ti=Waiver of Claims; Limitation of Liability

8.sec=Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this {_Agreement}, each party (the “{Def.Indemnifying_Party.Target}”) shall indemnify the other party and such other party’s affiliates (each such person an “{Def.Indemnified_Party.Target}”), against, and hold them harmless from, any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) suffered or incurred by any such {_Indemnified_Party} arising from or relating to any failure by the {_Indemnifying_Party} to comply with any applicable agreement or obligation under this {_Agreement} or the breach of any representation or warranty given herein. In addition, the {_Contributor} acknowledges and agrees that it shall not directly or indirectly take any action against a {_DAO} member or contributor under a general partnership theory of liability.


9.Ti=Miscellaneous

9.1.sec=This {_Agreement} and the {_Services} performed hereunder are personal to the {_Contributor} and the {_Contributor} shall not have the right or ability to assign, transfer or subcontract any obligations under this {_Agreement} without the written consent of the {_DAO}.  Any attempt to do so shall make the {_Agreement} void.  The {_DAO} shall be free to transfer any of its rights under this {_Agreement} to a third party.

9.2.sec=Any breach of Sections 3 or 4 will cause irreparable harm to the {_DAO} for which damages would not be an adequate remedy, and therefore, the {_DAO} shall be entitled to injunctive relief with respect thereto in addition to any other remedies.

9.3.sec=This is the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and no changes or modifications or waivers to this {_Agreement} shall be effective unless in writing and signed by both parties.  This {_Agreement} may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

9.4.sec=Counterparts may be delivered via facsimile, electronic mail (including pdf or any electronic signature complying with the U.S. federal ESIGN Act of 2000, Uniform Electronic Transactions Act or other applicable law) or other transmission method and any counterpart so delivered shall be deemed to have been duly and validly delivered and be valid and effective for all purposes.

9.5.sec=In the event that any provision of this {_Agreement} is determined to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this {_Agreement} shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.

9.6.sec=This {_Agreement} shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of {Law.State.the} without regard to the conflicts of law provisions thereof.

9.7.sec=In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under this {_Agreement}, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover costs and attorneys’ fees.  

9.8.sec=Any notice shall be given in writing by electronic mail or posting to the {_DAO}’s online coordination systems (including, but not limited to, Discord or Telegram) and addressed to the party to be notified at the e-mail address or username as the party may designate by 10 days’ advance written notice to the other party.
