YCombinator "SAFE" notes.  YCombinator published four variants.  These four are "refactored" here: the most complex of them, the Note with a Cap and a Discount, is used as a base for the other three.  The others consist of a set of changes and a link to the Cap and Discount note.<br>

  Here, we give four uses, of the four forms, all based on a single deal point list.  Again, the deal point list (in effect, its term sheet) is based on the most complex, the Cap and Discount.  The variations are made by linking to that, and linking to the desired form.<br>

In each (except the term sheet), click on "Document" to see the full document.

The forms are part of a "repo" for the SAFE Notes.  At <a href="http://github.com/CommonAccord/YC-Note-SAFE-CmA/">http://github.com/CommonAccord/YC-Note-SAFE-CmA/</a>.
