BuyerRemedy.4.2.sec=Buyer is under no duty to resell any Nonconforming Goods produced by or associated with Supplier or its Representative who Buyer has reasonable grounds to believe has not complied with Schedule P, whether or not such noncompliance was involved in the production of the specific Nonconforming Goods. Buyer is entitled to discard, destroy, export or donate any such Nonconforming Goods. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary or instructions otherwise provided by Supplier, destruction or donation of Nonconforming Goods rejected [or as to which acceptance was revoked],  and any conduct by Buyer required by law that would otherwise constitute acceptance, shall not be deemed acceptance and will not trigger a duty to pay for such Nonconforming Goods.

BuyerRemedy.5.2.sec=Notwithstanding Section {BuyerRemedy.5.1.Xnum}, Supplier’s obligation to indemnify Buyer shall be reduced proportionately to the degree that Buyer’s breach of Section {RemediatingAdverseImpacts.RemediationPlan.Xnum} [and/or Schedule Q] caused or contributed to Supplier’s breach of Schedule P; in other words, for the avoidance of doubt, damages shall be borne by Buyer directly to the extent Buyer has materially caused or contributed to the breach of Schedule P.

DisputeResolution.5.Ti=Mediation

Note=There appears to be an extraneous "]" in "through [arbitration][litigation] under Section {DisputeResolution.6.Xnum}]" in the following section. Presumably, this indicates the end of an optional span, but it is unclear where it begins. The "]" is also missing in the PDF mccs-full-report.pdf.  Perhaps it is merely extraneous. 

DisputeResolution.5.sec=If the parties do not resolve any Dispute within the periods specified in Section {DisputeResolution.4.Xnum}, either party may, by notice given in accordance with Section {RejectionOfGoods.1.3.Xnum} (the “Mediation Notice”), invite the other to resolve the Dispute under the [insert name of rules] as in effect on the date of this Agreement (the “{DefT.Mediation_Rules}”).
