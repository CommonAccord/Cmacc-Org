Ti=Buyer Remedies

1.Ti=Breach and Notice of Breach

1.sec=Upon breach by Supplier, Buyer may exercise remedies to the extent provided in this Article {BuyerRemedy.Xnum}.  Prior to the exercise of any remedies pursuant to Section {BuyerRemedy.2.Xnum}, Buyer shall notify Supplier in accordance with Section {RemediatingAdverseImpacts.NoticeOfViolation.Xnum}. Such notice, if with respect to an actual violation, constitutes notice of default under this Agreement.

2.Ti=Exercise of Remedies

2.Ti=Remedies shall be cumulative

2.0.sec=Remedies shall not be exclusive of, and shall be without prejudice to, any other remedies provided hereunder or at law or in equity. Buyer’s exercise of remedies and the timing thereof shall not be construed in any circumstance as constituting a waiver of its rights under this Agreement. Buyer’s remedies include, without limitation: 

Note: Optional 2.1

2.1.sec=Demanding adequate assurances from Supplier of due performance in conformity with Schedule P [after Buyer makes similar assurances to Supplier of its due performance under Section {ObligationToCombatAbuse.BuyerSupportOfSupplier.::Xnum//XnumAndScheduleQ}.

2.2.sec=Obtaining an injunction with respect to Supplier’s noncompliance with Schedule P (in which case, the parties represent to each other and agree that noncompliance with Schedule P causes Buyer great and irreparable harm for which Buyer has no adequate remedy at law and that the public interest would be served by injunctive and other equitable relief).

2.3.sec=Requiring Supplier to terminate an agreement or affiliation with a specific factory, terminate a subcontract or remove an employee or employees and/or other {_Representatives}.  

2.4.sec=Suspending payments, whether under this Agreement or other agreements, until Buyer determines, in Buyer’s reasonable discretion, that Supplier has taken appropriate remedial action following the expiration of the cure period indicated in Section {RejectionOfGoods.4.1.Xnum}. 

2.5.sec={Avoiding//Cancelling} this Agreement if permitted by Sections {RemediatingAdverseImpacts.RightToCure.2.Xnum}, {RemediatingAdverseImpacts.RightToTerminate.Xnum}, or {RejectionOfGoods.3.Xnum}.

2.6.sec=Obtaining damages, including all direct and consequential damages caused by the breach; provided, however, that damages shall be reduced proportionately to the degree that Buyer’s breach of Section {ObligationToCombatAbuse.BuyerSupportOfSupplier.::Xnum//XnumAndScheduleQ} caused or contributed to Supplier’s breach of Schedule P.

3.Ti=Damages

3.0.sec=Buyer and Supplier acknowledge: 

3.1.sec=Neither Buyer nor Supplier should benefit from a Schedule P violation or any human rights violation occurring in relation to this Agreement.  If damages are owed that would result in a benefit to Buyer or Supplier, such amounts should go toward supporting the remediation processes set out in Section {ObligationToCombatAbuse.OLGM.Xnum} and Article {RemediatingAdverseImpacts.Xnum}.  A “benefit” is here understood to mean being put in a better position than if this Agreement had been performed without a Schedule P Breach.  Nothing herein limits the right of a party to be put in the position it would have been in had this Agreement been performed without a Schedule P Breach.

Note=3.2 and 3.3 are optional.

3.2.sec=If there are insufficient funds to pay damages and complete the remediation processes set out in Section {ObligationToCombatAbuse.OLGM.Xnum} and Article {RemediatingAdverseImpacts.Xnum}, remediation shall take priority.

3.3.sec=It may be difficult for the parties to fix damages for injury to business, prospects, and reputation with respect to Nonconforming Goods produced in violation of Schedule P, and in such case, liquidated damages must be paid by Supplier to Buyer as follows: {LiquidatedDamagesFormula.cl}.

3.=[G/Z/ol-a/s3]

4.Ti=Return, Destruction or Donation  of Goods; Nonacceptance of Goods.

4.1.sec=Buyer may, in its sole discretion, store the rejected Nonconforming Goods for Supplier’s account, ship them back to Supplier or export them or, if permitted under applicable law, destroy or donate the Nonconforming Goods, all at Supplier’s sole cost, expense, and risk, except to the extent that Buyer has caused or contributed to the nonconformity by breach of Section {ObligationToCombatAbuse.BuyerSupportOfSupplier.::Xnum//XnumAndScheduleQ}.

4.2.sec=Buyer is under no duty to resell any Nonconforming Goods produced by or associated with Supplier or its Representative who Buyer has reasonable grounds to believe has not complied with Schedule P, whether or not such noncompliance was involved in the production of the specific Nonconforming Goods. Buyer is entitled to discard, destroy, export or donate any such Nonconforming Goods. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary or instructions otherwise provided by Supplier, destruction or donation of Nonconforming Goods rejected [or as to which acceptance was revoked],  and any conduct by Buyer required by law that would otherwise constitute acceptance, shall not be deemed acceptance and will not trigger a duty to pay for such Nonconforming Goods.   Buyer and Supplier represent and agree that this Section and any related Sections are an effort to mitigate damages, as selling, profiting from, and being associated with tainted goods or Nonconforming Goods is likely to be damaging to Buyer, including to Buyer’s reputation.

5.Ti=Indemnification; comparative fault calculation

5.1.sec=Supplier shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer and its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, successors and assigns (collectively, “{DefT.Indemnified_Party}”) against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, penalties, fines, costs or expenses of whatever kind, including, without limitation, the cost of storage, return, export or destruction of Goods, the difference in cost between Buyer’s purchase of Supplier’s Goods and replacement Goods, reasonable attorneys’ fees, audit fees that would not have been incurred but for Supplier’s Schedule P Breach, and the costs of enforcing any right under this Agreement or applicable law, in each case, that arise out of the violation of Schedule P by Supplier or any of its {_Representatives}. This Section shall apply, without limitation, regardless of whether claimants are contractual counterparties, investors, or any other person, entity, or governmental unit whatsoever.

5.2.sec=Notwithstanding Section {BuyerRemedy.5.1.Xnum}, Supplier’s obligation to indemnify Buyer shall be reduced proportionately to the degree that Buyer’s breach of Section {ObligationToCombatAbuse.BuyerSupportOfSupplier.::Xnum//XnumAndScheduleQ} caused or contributed to Supplier’s breach of Schedule P; in other words, for the avoidance of doubt, damages shall be borne by Buyer directly to the extent Buyer has materially caused or contributed to the breach of Schedule P.
