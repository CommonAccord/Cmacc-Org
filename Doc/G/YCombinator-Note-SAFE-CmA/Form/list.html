These are four variants of the YCombinator "SAFE" Notes.  They are demonstrated as part of <a href="index.php?action=list&file=F/Demo/Note_YC/">F/Demo/Note_YC/</a>.  The Cap_Discount is the most complex and serves as the base for the others.  The others are collections of patches on the Cap_Discount.  In the Demo, you'll see that we list the deal parameters once and make each of the variations by referencing the appropriate variation of the form.
