<center><font color="red">DRAFT - HYPOTHETICAL -  FOR DISCUSSION ONLY</font><br><b>IACCM MODEL COLLABORATIVE CONTRACTING POLICY</b></center><br><br>

The policy is intended to be used by an enterprise with its business partners and suppliers, including its outside lawyers.  Within the enterprise, the "owner" of the policy is the contract management function.<br><br>

The policy takes the perspective of a "receiving" party:  it presumes that the enterprise is receiving a proposal for contract text from a partner, customer or supplier.  The policy is intended to reduce the amount of reinvention and review for incoming materials.  The "receiving" perspective highlights the costs of a party insisting on its own forms and formats.  It facilitates cooperation and standards formation.<br><br>

Standards reduce needless work, delay, cost and risk.  Enterprises are rightly concerned with being "infected" by inappropriate or malicious contract terms, and the friction of renegotiation.  Variations, even benevolent variations, create complexity that is expensive for an enterprise to manage.  Forms, computable structures and common style rules reduce the "surface" of exposure and increase the ability of parties to focus on their business and relationships.<br><br>

This policy encourages the proposimg party to use existing materials familiar to the receiving party.  Ideally, the materials are hosted publicly and subject to a standards process. It leaves open the possibility that the other party will have good reasons to propose a new form or clause. Circumstances may be different, or the proposing party may have an improvement.  If formatted consistently, these additions will improve and expand the standard solutions.<br><BR>

The policy seeks to encourage reuse on three levels:<ol><li>Reuse of forms - a list of forms that the enterprise is comfortable with;<li>Reuse of clauses - libraries of contract components (mostly sections) that can be used as components, by copying or reference, and<li>Consistent formats - a style guide and components for drafting. </ol>  It encourages codification by borrowing a secure method of collaboration from software engineering and using it with public libraries of "Prose Objects".</ol>

The policy itself is a document standard that uses the modular formats and versioning it recommends.
