3.Ti=Timing of Maintenance Fees & SaaS Subscriptions

3.Ti/Note=This is meant to ensure <a href='#Def.Customer.sec' class='definedterm'>Customer</a> doesn't pay for maintenance or <a href='#Def.SaaS.sec' class='definedterm'>SaaS</a> before systems are in use. This is generally unpopular with vendors.

3.sec=Notwithstanding any provision of an <a href='#Def.Addendum.sec' class='definedterm'>Addendum</a> to the contrary: (A) no fees for maintenance of <a href='#Def.Licensed_Software.sec' class='definedterm'>Licensed Software</a> or <a href='#Def.SaaS.sec' class='definedterm'>SaaS</a>, including without limitation for Upgrades (as defined in Subsection 15.1(b) above), will accrue before Go-Live (as defined below); and (B) no period before Go-Live will be counted against the time covered by any maintenance period. Unless the applicable <a href='#Def.Software/SaaS_Addendum.sec' class='definedterm'>Software/SaaS Addendum</a> provides to the contrary, no fees for use of <a href='#Def.SaaS.sec' class='definedterm'>SaaS</a> will accrue before Go-Live, and no period before Go-Live will be counted against the time covered by any <a href='#Def.SaaS.sec' class='definedterm'>SaaS</a> subscription fees.
