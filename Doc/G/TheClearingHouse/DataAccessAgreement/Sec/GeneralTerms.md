4.Ti=ARTICLE 4 DATA ACCESS

4.1.Ti=Access Rights.

4.1.sec=Subject to the terms of the {_Agreement} (including the suspension and termination provisions herein), {_FSE} will permit {_Data_Recipient}, and {_Data_Recipient} agrees, to use and access the {_Data_Access_Method} solely in order for {_Data_Recipient} to collect {_Applicable_Account_Information} of {_Designated_Customer}s as authorized by each respective {_Designated_Customer} in support of {_Data_Recipient} or {_Data_Recipient_Client}s providing the {_Data_Recipient_Service}(s) to that {_Designated_Customer}.

11.2.2.sec={_FSE} may terminate the {_Agreement} with immediate effect upon notice to {_Data_Recipient} if {_FSE} in good faith believes that its continued participation in the {_Agreement} will result in a violation of any applicable {_Law} or adversely impact the {_FSE_Entities}’ compliance with {_Laws} (including regulatory guidelines or requirements, or if there is {_Security_Breach}).

11.2.3.sec={_FSE} may, by giving written notice to {_Data_Recipient}, terminate the {_Agreement} in whole or in part for cause as of a date specified in a notice of termination if any of the following occurs: (i) a {_Data_Recipient_Entity} breaches in any material respect any of its obligations under the {_Agreement} which breach is not cured within 30 days after notice of the breach is given by {_FSE} to {_Data_Recipient} or such breach is not capable of being cured within 30 days; (ii) a {_Data_Recipient_Entity} fails to comply with the compliance, confidentiality or data protection or use requirements under the {_Agreement}; (iii) a material control weakness associated with the {_Agreement} is identified that {_FSE} is required to disclose or is advised to disclose in public filings of {_FSE} or an {_FSE_Entity}; or (iv) a {_Data_Recipient_Entity} becomes the subject of any action or investigation by any Government Authority or regulatory agency that in {_FSE}’s judgment could render {_Data_Recipient} unable to meet its obligations under the {_Agreement}, involves material fraud or financial irregularities by or on behalf of the {_Data_Recipient_Entity} or any illegal activities by or on behalf of {_Data_Recipient_Entity}, or in {_FSE}’s judgment could negatively impact {_FSE}'s reputation.

FtNt.4.sec=Add any branding requirements, if any, to be included on the {_Account_Information}, including any disclaimers.

13.2.Ti=Obligations.

13.2.sec=Each {_Party} will treat all Confidential Information of the other {_Party} as confidential and will disclose such Confidential Information only to those individuals with a reasonable need to know within their organizations (provided that such individuals are bound by the confidentiality obligations in the {_Agreement}). Each {_Party} will use at least the same degree of care to prevent disclosing to third parties the Confidential Information of the other as it employs to avoid unauthorized disclosure, publication or dissemination of its own information of a similar nature, but in no event less than a reasonable standard of care. A {_Party} may disclose Confidential Information of the other {_Party} to advisors, Auditors and other {_Representative}s necessary to perform, assess or interpret such {_Party}’s obligations under the {_Agreement}, and subject to such third party agreeing to confidentiality obligations substantially equivalent to those set forth in the {_Agreement}, where (a) the use of such an entity is authorized under the {_Agreement} or such disclosure is reasonably necessary to or otherwise naturally occurs in that third party's scope of responsibility and solely for the benefit and (b) the disclosure is in accordance with the {_Agreement}. Neither {_Party} will (i) make any use or copies of the Confidential Information of the other except as necessary to perform its obligations under the {_Agreement}, (ii) acquire any right in or assert any lien against the Confidential Information of the other, or (iii) refuse for any reason (including a default or material breach of the {_Agreement} by the other {_Party}) to promptly provide the other {_Party}'s Confidential Information (including all copies thereof) to it if requested in writing to do so.

In addition, {_Data_Recipient} will ensure that {_Data_Recipient_Entities} comply with these confidentiality provisions, and that all {_Data_Recipient_Entities} handling such Confidential Information have been appropriately trained in the implementation of the applicable information security policies and procedures. {_Data_Recipient} is responsible and liable for all acts and omissions of all {_Data_Recipient_Entities}. {_Data_Recipient} must regularly audit and review the respective information security policies and procedures of the {_Data_Recipient_Entities} to ensure their continued effectiveness and determine whether adjustments are necessary in light of circumstances including changes in technology, customer information systems or threats or hazards to Confidential Information. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth elsewhere in the {_Agreement}, each {_Party} will be permitted to (1) identify the other {_Party} by name, and (2) disclose the existence of the {_Agreement} and the terms and conditions of the {_Agreement} to its advisors, Auditors and other {_Representative}s.

13.5.sec={_Data_Recipient} acknowledges that {_FSE} is required to comply with the information security standards required by the {_Privacy_Regulations}. If applicable, {_Data_Recipient} will comply with (and cause all other {_Data_Recipient_Entities} to comply with), and assist {_FSE} in complying with, {_Privacy_Regulations} and the {_FSE_Security_Requirements}.

Part 681 is applicable to a {_Data_Recipient_Entity}, {_Data_Recipient} will ensure that there are policies and procedures to detect patterns, practices, or specific activity that indicates the possible existence of identity theft (“{DefT.Red_Flag}s”) that may arise in the performance of any obligations under the {_Agreement} and report the {_Red_Flag}s to {_FSE} and take appropriate steps to prevent or mitigate identity theft.

13.7.6.sec=The {_Data_Recipient_Entities} will cooperate with {_FSE} in connection with efforts to assess and remediate a {_Cyber_Risk}.

13.7.7.sec=The {_Data_Recipient_Entities} will only transfer (including internal transfers that occur beyond the internal firewalls of {_Data_Recipient} or a {_Data_Recipient_Client}) the {_FSE_Materials}, {_Account_Information} and {_Personal_Information} in a secure and confidential manner, including, at a minimum, encrypting the data in accordance with {_FSE} policies and restrictions set forth in Exhibit 2 or through establishing a virtual private network with the {_FSE_Entities} in a manner as approved by {_FSE}, and will comply with all security provisions and procedures set forth in {_FSE}’s data protection policies and procedures set forth in Exhibit 2.

13.7.9.sec={_Data_Recipient} and {_Data_Recipient_Subcontractor}s will use an {_FSE} approved real-time intrusion detection system on all {_Data_Recipient} Access Systems. {_Data_Recipient} will actively monitor the intrusion detection system for activities that correspond to attempts at breaking the security of the {_Data_Recipient} Access Systems. Along with the deployment of such an intrusion detection system, {_Data_Recipient} and {_Data_Recipient_Subcontractor}s will adopt and follow operational procedures to disable the source of any perceived attack and escalation procedures to notify {_FSE} and {_Data_Recipient} security groups for follow-up action.

13.7.10.sec={_Data_Recipient} and {_Data_Recipient_Subcontractor}s will provide real-time security event logging data for all {_Data_Recipient} Access Systems that contain, process, transact or in any way make up the control or processing environment of the {_FSE_Entities}’ data or systems, to a log retention server that {_FSE} designates and operates.
