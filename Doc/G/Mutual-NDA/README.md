# Mutual-NDA

### How was this agreement created?
The Common Paper MNDA was created by a committee of over 40 attorneys representing technology vendors, procurement teams, boutique firms, and Big Law.

### I see this agreement is hosted online. Does that mean it will change?
Version 1 of this agreement will remain unchanged and hosted on [this page forever](https://commonpaper.com/standards/mutual-NDA/1.0). Over time, we will create new versions to accommodate changes to the law and additional use cases. We expect future changes to occur infrequently, and they will always be posted as a new version.

### How do I use this agreement?
To execute an agreement using the Common Paper MNDA, first download a copy of the Cover Sheet in your preferred format. Then finalize the terms of the agreement with your counterparty and input those terms into the corresponding bracketed section of the Cover Sheet. Finally, sign your Cover Sheet with your counterparty via the signing process of your choice. The Cover Sheet incorporates the Standard Terms by reference, completing the executed agreement. Watch this short video to see the process in action.
