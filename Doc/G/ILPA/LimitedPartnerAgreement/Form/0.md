The General Partner shall, subject to such legal, tax or regulatory considerations, cause each Parallel Vehicle to co-invest with the Fund in each Portfolio Company in proportion to the respective capital commitments of the Parallel Vehicles and the Fund.  All references in this Section {General.ParallelVehicle.Xnum} ({General.ParallelVehicle.Ti}) to the Investors of a Parallel Vehicle shall be deemed to include all Investors in a Parallel Vehicle formed as a vehicle other than a limited partnership.
General.ParallelVehicle.2.sec=Each investment by a Parallel Vehicle shall, subject to legal, tax or regulatory considerations, be on substantially the same terms as, and on economic terms that are no more than favorable to such Parallel Vehicle than, those received by the Fund.

General.AlternativeVehicle.1.sec=If at any time the General Partner determines that for legal, tax or regulatory reasons it would be in the best interests of the Limited Partners for certain or all of the Limited Partners to participate in a Portfolio Investment through one or more alternative investment structures, the General Partner may effect the making of all or any portion of such investment outside of the Fund by requiring certain or all Limited Partners to make capital contributions with respect to such potential portfolio investment to a limited partnership or other similar vehicle (each, an “Alternative Vehicle”) provided that, that no Limited Partner will be required to participate in any such investment through an Alternative Vehicle unless (i) all Limited Partners are participating in such investment through such Alternative Vehicle, or (ii) the General Partner obtains prior written consent from such Limited Partner.
General.AlternativeVehicle.2.sec=Each Alternative Vehicle shall be controlled by the General Partner or an Affiliate thereof, shall be managed by the Fund Manager or an Affiliate thereof, and shall be governed by organizational documents containing provisions substantially the same in all material respects as those of the Fund (including this Agreement), with only such differences as may be required to accommodate the legal, tax or regulatory requirements referred to in Section {General.AlternativeVehicle.1.Xnum}.

General.AlternativeVehicle.4.sec=Each Limited Partner investing in an Alternative Vehicle shall be obligated to make contributions to such Alternative Vehicle in a manner consistent with that provided by Article {CapitalContribution.Xnum} ({CapitalContribution.Ti}), and each such Limited Partner’s Remaining Commitment shall be reduced by the amount of such contributions to the same extent as if such contributions were made to the Fund as Capital Contributions.  With respect to each investment or proposed investment in which an Alternative Vehicle participates or proposes to participate with the Fund, any expenses or indemnification or other obligations related to such investment or proposed investment shall be borne by, and any Fee Income shall be allocated among, the Fund and such Alternative Vehicle in proportion to the capital committed by or proposed to be committed by each to such investment.  Any management fee funded by a Limited Partner with respect to an Alternative Vehicle shall reduce such Limited Partner’s share of the Management Fee required to be funded by such Limited Partner, and payable to the Fund Manager by the Fund by a corresponding amount.  Distributions of cash and other property and the allocations of income, gain, loss, deduction, expense and credit from such Alternative Vehicle, and the determination of allocations and distributions pursuant to Article {Distribution.Xnum} ({Distribution.Ti}) and of any Capital Contribution or other payment by a Limited Partner pursuant to Article {CapitalContribution.Xnum} ({CapitalContribution.Ti}) or any other amount contributed to or distributed by any Alternative Vehicle, shall be determined as if each contribution to or distribution by such Alternative Vehicle were a contribution to or distribution by the Fund.  The investment results of an Alternative Vehicle shall be aggregated with the investment results of the Fund for all purposes unless at the time the investment is made by the Alternative Vehicle the General Partner otherwise determines with the consent of the Advisory Committee and prior notice to the Limited Partners, that such aggregation increases the risk of any adverse tax consequences or imposes legal or regulatory constraints or creates other risks that would be undesirable for the Fund or the Limited Partners.  If any Limited Partner defaults with respect to its obligations to an Alternative Vehicle, (i) such Limited Partner shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Partner under this Agreement to the same extent as if such default to the Alternative Vehicle had occurred under the terms of this Agreement and (ii) the remedies imposed by the General Partner against such Defaulting Partner shall be aggregated with the remedies imposed against such Person under the governing documents of the Alternative Vehicle so that, to the greatest extent practicable, such aggregated remedies would put the Fund and the Defaulting Partner in the same positions they each would have been in had such Defaulting Partner made its entire Commitment to the Fund rather than through both the Fund and the Alternative Vehicle.
General.AlternativeVehicle.5.sec=In the event that the General Partner or an Affiliate thereof forms one or more Alternative Vehicles, the provisions of this Agreement, whether or not amended, shall be interpreted to give effect to the intent of the provisions of this Section {General.AlternativeVehicle.Xnum} ({General.AlternativeVehicle.Ti}).  Accordingly, if any such Alternative Vehicle is formed, all references in this Agreement to the Fund shall, where appropriate, be deemed to include such Alternative Vehicle.  The limited partnership agreement and other organizational documents of any Alternative Vehicle shall be executed on behalf of the Limited Partners investing therein by the General Partner pursuant to the power of attorney granted by each of the Limited Partners pursuant to Section {Amend.5.Xnum} ({Amend.5.Ti}).

General.AdjustBetweenVehicle.2.sec=The General Partner shall, after the payments, distributions, reallocations and adjustments described in this Section {General.AdjustBetweenVehicle.Xnum} ({General.AdjustBetweenVehicle.Ti}) are taken into account, cause each Portfolio Investment, to the extent practicable and appropriate and subject to adjustments made by the General Partner with respect to any Portfolio Investment realized before the admission of a Subsequent Closing Partner (or equivalent in any Fund Vehicle), shall be held by the Fund Vehicles in such proportions as if all of the Fund Vehicles had a single closing on the Initial Closing Date at which all Limited Partners and limited partners or equivalent investors of all Fund Vehicles were admitted with a commitment equal to their commitment as of the Final Closing Date, and all Partners and investors in any other Fund Vehicle shall have received such amounts by way of distribution of Equalization Payment and Additional Payments (or the equivalent under the documentation relating to any other Fund Vehicle) as they would have received had they all invested in the Fund.  Final determinations regarding such reallocations shall be made by the General Partner within {AdjustmentsBetweenVehicles.CompletedWithin.days} after the Final Closing Date.

Closing.Ti=CLOSINGS

Closing.1.Ti=Subsequent Closings

ProofersNote=It is strange to have a heading "Closings", then a single subsection entitled "Subsequent Closings".  I would suggest that the subheading be removed and the subsection 6.1.* be renumbered as 6.*. Or is something else going on here?

Closing.1.1.sec=Subject to Section {CapitalCommit.MaxFundSize.Xnum} ({CapitalCommit.MaxFundSize.Ti}), the General Partner shall have full power and authority to schedule one or more additional closings (each such closing, a “Subsequent Closing”) on any date not later than the Final Closing Date to admit one or more additional Limited Partners and to allow any existing Limited Partner to increase its Commitment to the Fund (each such Person, a “Subsequent Closing Partner”).

Closing.1.5.sec=Any Equalization Payment, other than any portion attributable to the Management Fee, and Additional Payment received by the Fund shall be either (i) distributed to the Prior Partners pro rata to their Capital Contributions at such time or (ii) to the extent deemed appropriate or necessary by the General Partner to adjust the proportionate share of each Fund Vehicle in each Portfolio Investment to reflect changes in the relative capital commitments following the Initial Closing Date as a result of any Limited Partner’s admission or increase in its Commitment, paid or distributed to such Fund Vehicles in a manner comparable to the mechanics of this Section {Closing.1.Xnum} ({Closing.1.Ti}) as applied to the Fund Vehicles.  Any portion of an Equalization Payment attributable to the Management Fee shall be paid to the Fund Manager.
Closing.1.6.sec=The General Partner shall appropriately adjust the Partners’ Capital Contributions, Sharing Percentages and Remaining Commitments and any other relevant items to give effect to the intent of the foregoing.  Additional Payments contributed by a Subsequent Closing Partner shall not be treated as Capital Contributions and shall not reduce such Subsequent Closing Partner’s Remaining Commitment.  For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any Subsequent Closing Partner, its Preferred Return shall be calculated from the date as if it had been admitted at the Initial Closing Date.

In addition to the foregoing, the General Partner may institute a lawsuit against any Defaulting Partner for specific performance of its obligations to make Capital Contributions and to collect any overdue amounts hereunder, with interest on such overdue amounts at the rate specified in Section {CapitalContribution.Default.3.Xnum}.

CodersNote=There is a non-conforming format - the first three sections have no title, but section 4 does.  I have added a title to section 5, and fudged the other sections by using ".Sec=" instead of ".sec=".

FundManagement.4.1.Sec=Each quarterly installment of the Management Fee with respect to each Limited Partner shall be reduced, but not below zero, by an amount equal to such Limited Partner’s pro rata share (based on its Commitment) of the aggregate amount of Fee Income paid since the preceding Payment Date.  To the extent that the Management Fee is not reduced as of any given Payment Date by the amounts referred to in the preceding sentence (or any portion thereof determined with respect to a previous Payment Date and carried over to the current Payment Date pursuant to this sentence) because the Management Fee has been reduced to zero, the excess shall be carried over to the next succeeding Payment Date (and to one or more subsequent Payment Dates) and applied as a reduction of the Management Fee, but not below zero, for such succeeding Payment Date (or a subsequent Payment Date).  If on termination of the Fund, any amount of Fee Income remains that has not been applied to reduce the Management Fee pursuant to this Section {FundManagement.4.Xnum} ({FundManagement.4.Ti}), the Fund Manager shall cause such amounts to be paid to the Non-Defaulting Partners (excluding any such Non-Defaulting Partners that have elected by written notice to the General Partner not to received such amounts) pro rata in proportion to their respective Commitments.
FundManagement.4.2.Sec=For the purposes of determining the Value of any Fee Income in the form of Securities, awards, options, warrants or other non-cash consideration, such Value shall be equal to the net cash proceeds thereof as and when such proceeds are received; provided that the Value of any such non-cash Fee Income the Value of which has not been determined on or before the dissolution of the Fund shall be determined on such date by reference to the Value of such Portfolio Company upon such disposition.  Such Value shall be disclosed to the Advisory Committee and shall be subject to Section {AdvisorCommittee.2.5.5.Xnum}.
FundManagement.4.3.Sec=The reduction of Management Fees described in this Section {FundManagement.4.Xnum} ({FundManagement.4.Ti}) may be (i) allocated among the Fund Vehicles and other investment entities managed by the General Partner, the Fund Manager or their Affiliates, whether formed prior to, on or after the date hereof which own the same Securities, based on the relative cost basis of each such entity’s interest in the relevant Portfolio Company, and (ii) deducted from the Management Fee otherwise payable by the Fund in the fiscal quarter immediately following the date of receipt of the relevant Fee Income or the calculation of the Value of the relevant non-cash Fee Income pursuant to Section {FundManagement.4.2.Xnum}; provided, however, that no such Fee Income shall be allocated to any entity that does not pay a management fee that will be reduced by that entity’s allocable portion of such Fee Income (and for the avoidance of doubt any such allocable portion of such Fee Income shall be allocated among such other entities).
FundManagement.4.4.sec=Plan Asset Regulations
FundManagement.4.4.1.sec=Each Limited Partner acknowledges that the assets of the Fund are not intended to constitute Plan Assets of such Limited Partner for purposes of any applicable non-U.S., state or local law governing the investment and management of the assets of that Limited Partner, and that, as a result, none of the Fund, the General Partner or any of their Affiliates intends to be acting as a fiduciary within the meaning of any applicable non-U.S., state or local law relating to governmental plans or foreign plans with respect to such Limited Partner or the Fund assets; provided, that this provision is not intended to negate the standard of care set forth in Section {Misc.5.Xnum} ({Misc.5.Ti}).
FundManagement.4.4.2.sec=The General Partner shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Fund either (i) qualifies as a VCOC on and after the “initial valuation date” (as defined in the Plan Asset Regulation) of the Fund or (ii) otherwise is not deemed to hold Plan Assets under the Plan Asset Regulation.  If participation by “Benefit Plan Investors” is “significant” as determined under the Plan Asset Regulation, at the Fund’s expense, the General Partner shall furnish to each ERISA Partner (x) within ten (10) Business Days following the Fund’s first long-term Portfolio Investment, an opinion of counsel addressed to the Fund with respect to the VCOC status of the Fund and (y) within sixty (60) days following the end of each “annual valuation period” (as defined in the Plan Asset Regulation) of the Fund succeeding the date of the Fund’s first long-term Portfolio Investment, a certificate from the Fund as to the Fund’s qualification as a VCOC.

Record-Report.4.2.sec=Each Partner authorizes the General Partner to amend this Section {Record-Report.4.Xnum} ({Record-Report.4.Ti}) to the extent necessary to achieve similar tax treatment with respect to any interest in the Fund transferred to a service provider by the Fund in connection with services provided to the Fund as set forth in Section 4 of the IRS Notice (e.g., to reflect changes from the rules set forth in the IRS Notice in subsequent U.S. Department of Treasury or Internal Revenue Service guidance).

Record-Report.5.2.sec=The General Partner shall cause the Fund not to engage, directly or indirectly, in a transaction that, as of the date the Fund enters into a binding contract to engage in such transaction, would cause a Limited Partner subject to the excise tax in Section 4965 of the Code to be treated as a party to a “prohibited tax shelter transaction” for purposes of Section 4965 of the Code.  If the General Partner reasonably determines that the Fund has engaged, directly or indirectly, in a transaction that is a prohibited tax shelter transaction, the General Partner shall promptly notify the affected Limited Partners of such determination and permit such Limited Partners to be excused from participating in such transaction or having any economic rights or liabilities associated with such transaction.
