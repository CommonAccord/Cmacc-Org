LawyersNote=This clause is taken from the ROFR, the first paragraph of its Assignment of Rights clause.  It differs very slightly from that in the SPA and Voting Agreement, but the differences are not material.  There is "permitted assigns" instead of "assigns" and there is an Oxford comma as "obligations,".  We remove the Oxford comma because it is inconsistent with the rest of the documents.
