TermSheet: Is "holder" of Series A Preferred, the same thing as "Investor"?  Why two ways of saying it?  In COI - "Preferred Stock" is expressly "Series A Preferred". In TermSheet is "Series A Preferred" but in other documents it is "Series A Preferred Stock" - why the inconsistency?


The Indemn Agmt treats Law and Dispute under a single heading and differently than most of the other Agmts.  They have a GoverningLaw section and a DisputeResolution.
