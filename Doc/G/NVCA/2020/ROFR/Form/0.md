If the options to purchase the remaining shares are exercised in full by the Exercising Investors, the Company shall immediately notify all of the Exercising Investors and the selling Key Holder of that fact.

Core.FirstRefusal.5.sec=Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the total number of shares of Transfer Stock that the Company and the Investors have agreed to purchase in the Company Notice, Investor Notices and Undersubscription Notices is less than the total number of shares of Transfer Stock, then the Company and the Investors shall be deemed to have forfeited any right to purchase such Transfer Stock, and the selling Key Holder shall be free to sell all, but not less than all, of the Transfer Stock to the Prospective Transferee on terms and conditions substantially similar to (and in no event more favorable than) the terms and conditions set forth in the Proposed Transfer Notice, it being understood and agreed that (i) any such sale or transfer shall be subject to the other terms and restrictions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the terms and restrictions set forth in Sections {Core.CoSale.Xnum} and {Misc.Assign.2.Xnum}; (ii) any future Proposed Key Holder Transfer shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including this Section {Core.Xnum}; and (iii) such sale shall be consummated within forty-five (45) days after receipt of the Proposed Transfer Notice by the Company and, if such sale is not consummated within such forty-five (45) day period, such sale shall again become subject to the Right of First Refusal and Secondary Refusal Right on the terms set forth herein.]

Core.FirstRefusal.6.sec=If the consideration proposed to be paid for the Transfer Stock is in property, services or other non-cash consideration, the fair market value of the consideration shall be as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors and as set forth in the Company Notice.

The closing of the purchase of Transfer Stock by the Company and the Investors shall take place, and all payments from the Company and the Investors shall have been delivered to the selling Key Holder, by the later of (i) the date specified in the Proposed Transfer Notice as the intended date of the Proposed Key Holder Transfer; and (ii) [forty-five (45)] days after delivery of the Proposed Transfer Notice.

Core.CoSale.1.Ti=Exercise of Right

Core.CoSale.1.sec=If any Transfer Stock subject to a Proposed Key Holder Transfer is not purchased pursuant to Section {Core.FirstRefusal.Xnum} above and thereafter is to be sold to a Prospective Transferee, each respective Investor may elect to exercise its Right of Co-Sale and participate on a pro rata basis in the Proposed Key Holder Transfer as set forth in Section {Core.CoSale.2.Xnum} below and, subject to Section {Core.CoSale.4.Xnum}, otherwise on the same terms and conditions specified in the Proposed Transfer Notice. Each Investor who desires to exercise its Right of Co-Sale (each, a “{DefT.Participating_Investor}”) must give the selling Key Holder written notice to that effect within fifteen (15) days after the deadline for delivery of the Secondary Notice described above, and upon giving such notice such Participating Investor shall be deemed to have effectively exercised the Right of Co-Sale.

Core.CoSale.2.Ti=Shares Includable

[To the extent one (1) or more of the Participating Investors exercise such right of participation in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein, the number of shares of Transfer Stock that the selling Key Holder may sell in the Proposed Key Holder Transfer shall be correspondingly reduced.]

Core.CoSale.3.Ti=Purchase and Sale Agreement

Core.CoSale.3.sec=The Participating Investors and the selling Key Holder agree that the terms and conditions of any Proposed Key Holder Transfer in accordance with this Section {Core.CoSale.Xnum} will be memorialized in, and governed by, a written purchase and sale agreement with the Prospective Transferee (the “{DefT.Purchase_and_Sale_Agreement}”) with customary terms and provisions for such a transaction, and the Participating Investors and the selling Key Holder further covenant and agree to enter into such Purchase and Sale Agreement as a condition precedent to any sale or other transfer in accordance with this Section {Core.CoSale.Xnum}.

Core.CoSale.4.2.sec=In the event that the Proposed Key Holder Transfer constitutes a Change of Control, the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement shall provide that the aggregate consideration from such transfer shall be allocated to the Participating Investors and the selling Key Holder in accordance with Sections 2.1 and 2.2 of Article IV(B) of the Restated Certificate [and, if applicable, the next sentence] as if (A) such transfer were a Deemed Liquidation Event (as defined in the Restated Certificate), and (B) the Capital Stock sold in accordance with the Purchase and Sale Agreement were the only Capital Stock outstanding.   [In the event that a portion of the aggregate consideration payable to the Participating Investor(s) and selling Key Holder is placed into escrow and/or is payable only upon satisfaction of contingencies, the Purchase and Sale Agreement shall provide that (x) the portion of such consideration that is not placed in escrow and is not subject to contingencies (the “{DefT.Initial_Consideration}”) shall be allocated in accordance with Sections 2.1 and 2.2 of Article IV(B) of the Restated Certificate as if the Initial Consideration were the only consideration payable in connection with such transfer, and (y) any additional consideration which becomes payable to the Participating Investor(s) and selling Key Holder upon release from escrow or satisfaction of such contingencies shall be allocated in accordance with Sections 2.1 and 2.2 of Article IV(B) of the Restated Certificate after taking into account the previous payment of the Initial Consideration as part of the same transfer.]

In connection with such purchase by the selling Key Holder, such Participating Investor or Investors shall deliver to the selling Key Holder any stock certificate or certificates, properly endorsed for transfer, representing the Capital Stock being purchased by the selling Key Holder (or request that the Company effect such transfer in the name of the selling Key Holder).
