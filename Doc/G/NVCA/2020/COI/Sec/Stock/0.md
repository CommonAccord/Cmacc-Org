Preferred.OptionalConversion.3.Ti=Mechanics of Conversion

Preferred.OptionalConversion.3.1.Ti=Notice of Conversion

Preferred.OptionalConversion.3.1.sec=In order for a holder of {_Preferred_Stock} to voluntarily convert shares of {_Preferred_Stock} into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall (a) provide written notice to the Corporation’s transfer agent at the office of the transfer agent for the {_Preferred_Stock} (or at the principal office of the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent) that such holder elects to convert all or any number of such holder’s shares of {_Preferred_Stock} and, if applicable, any event on which such conversion is contingent and (b), if such holder’s shares are certificated, surrender the certificate or certificates for such shares of {_Preferred_Stock} (or, if such registered holder alleges that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate), at the office of the transfer agent for the {_Preferred_Stock} (or at the principal office of the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent).  Such notice shall state such holder’s name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes the shares of Common Stock to be issued.  If required by the Corporation, any certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or his, her or its attorney duly authorized in writing.  The close of business on the date of receipt by the transfer agent (or by the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent) of such notice and, if applicable, certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) shall be the time of conversion (the “{DefT.Conversion_Time}”), and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the specified shares shall be deemed to be outstanding of record as of such date.  The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after the Conversion Time (i) [issue and deliver to such holder of {_Preferred_Stock}, or to his, her or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof and a certificate for the number (if any) of the shares of {_Preferred_Stock} represented by the surrendered certificate that were not converted into Common Stock] , and (ii) pay all declared but unpaid dividends on the shares of {_Preferred_Stock} converted.

Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing the Conversion Price below the then par value of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the {_Preferred_Stock}, the Corporation will take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Price.

Preferred.OptionalConversion.3.3.Ti=Effect of Conversion

Preferred.OptionalConversion.3.3.sec=All shares of {_Preferred_Stock} which shall have been surrendered for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares shall immediately cease and terminate at the Conversion Time, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor and to receive payment of any dividends declared but unpaid thereon.   Any shares of {_Preferred_Stock} so converted shall be retired and cancelled and may not be reissued as shares of such series, and the Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of {_Preferred_Stock} accordingly. 

Preferred.OptionalConversion.3.4.Ti=No Further Adjustment

Preferred.OptionalConversion.3.4.sec=Upon any such conversion, no adjustment to the Conversion Price shall be made for any declared but unpaid dividends on the {_Preferred_Stock} surrendered for conversion or on the Common Stock delivered upon conversion.

Preferred.OptionalConversion.3.5.sec=The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other similar taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of shares of {_Preferred_Stock} pursuant to this Section {Preferred.OptionalConversion.Xnum}.  The Corporation shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the shares of {_Preferred_Stock} so converted were registered, and no such issuance or delivery shall be made unless and until the person or entity requesting such issuance has paid to the Corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has been paid.
