# NVCA-2020-COI
https://nvca.org/recommends/nvca-2020-certificate-of-incorporation-2/

A rough ProseObject for the NVCA 2020 Certificate of Incorporation.

It has two main parts - the "Form" - which is the basic corporate resolution form, and the /Sec/Stock/0.md, which is the text of the provisions relating to the stock - Common and Preferred.

This is rough - all the text is there, but so are the many, many options and alternatives marked in the original text by square brackets.  Only a few of the larger alternative choices between sections have been automated. 

GitHub Copilot says:

The goal is to make it easy to create a new company with the NVCA 2020 COI, and to make it easy to change the company's stock provisions to match the company's needs.
