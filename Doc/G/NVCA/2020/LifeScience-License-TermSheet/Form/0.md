NetSales.2.2.sec=If the {_Licensed_Product} components containing only the {_Licensed_Compound} as its Active Ingredient are sold separately from the {_Other_Components}, but the {_Other_Components} in such {_Combination_Product} are not sold separately, then the proration factor will be determined by the formula [A / C], where A is the average gross sales price of all {_Licensed_Product} components containing only the {_Licensed_Compound} as its Active Ingredient  during such period when sold separately from the {_Other_Components}, and C is the average gross sales price of the {_Combination_Product} during such period;
 
NetSales.2.3.sec=If the {_Licensed_Product} components containing only the {_Licensed_Compound} as its  Active Ingredient are not sold separately from the {_Other_Components}, but the {_Other_Components} in such {_Combination_Product} are sold separately, then the proration factor will be determined by the formula [(C- B) / C], where B is the average gross sales price of the {_Other_Components} included in such {_Combination_Product} if sold separately from the {_Other_Component}(s), and C is the average gross sales price of the {_Combination_Product} during such period; or

NetSales.2.4.sec=If neither the {_Licensed_Compound} nor the {_Other_Components} included in the {_Combination_Product} were sold or provided separately during the relevant period, then the proration factor will be mutually agreed upon by the parties in good faith based on the relative value contributed by each component and, to the extent the parties are unable to establish such proration factor, then such proration factor will be established by Standard Dispute Resolution. 

NetSales.2.5.sec=In the event that such separate sales were not made or performed during the immediately preceding calendar year (“{DefT.CY}”), then the invoiced amounts for the {_Combination_Product} for purposes of calculating Net Sales will be multiplied by the fraction C/(C + D), where C is the average fully burdened cost of manufacture of the {_Licensed_Products} during the immediately preceding {_CY} and D is the average fully burdened cost of manufacture of the additional items during the immediately preceding {_CY}, in each case calculated in accordance with GAAP. 

NetSales.2.=[G/Z/ol-a/s5]

NetSales.3.sec=Any allocation of revenue from the sale or other disposition of {_Combination_Products}, or any allocation of the costs of manufacture, shall be done in good faith, and will take into consideration revenue recognition guidance under GAAP which is applicable to multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements.

NetSales.4.sec=All allocations of discounts, allowance, credits, rebates and other deductions must be reasonable.  Any amounts received or invoiced by a {_Selling_Party} will be accounted for only once.

NetSales.5.sec=Amounts received or invoiced by {_Licensee} or a {_Sublicensee} for the sale of a {_Licensed_Product} among {_Licensee} or a {_Sublicensee} will not be included in the computation of Net Sales, unless the purchasing entity is the end-user of such {_Licensed_Product}. 

NetSales.6.sec=Net Sales will exclude any {_Licensed_Product} transferred or disposed of as samples or for clinical trials or at or below costs of goods therefor for any so-called treatment investigational new drug sales, named patient sales, expanded access program, compassionate or emergency use sales or pre-license sales made for non-commercial, compassionate purpose, or any indigent program or promotional or educational purposes; in each case with respect to such {_Licensed_Product} and are reported on the royalty report for such period when such {_Licensed_Products} are so transferred or disposed of. 

NetSales.7.sec=Net Sales will be calculated in accordance with the standard internal policies and procedures of the {_Selling_Party}.
