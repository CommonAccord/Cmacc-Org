ProofersNote=In many places in the document, we have aerated sub-subsections.  The original has long paragraphs with lots of subnumbers (i), (ii) and the like. We have made them into real lists, indented and all that, for clarity (letting them breathe). (In cyberspace, whitespace is free. No trees are harmed unless you print.)

ProofersNote=Section 1.3 has one (1) section, labeled (a).  That is inconsistent with other sections and unneeded.  It should be Section 1.3, not Section 1.3(a). Have made the change. In the {Misc.DisputeResolution.Sec}, have renumbered some of the subsections in the process of aerating them.
