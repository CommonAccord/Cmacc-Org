Doc.Ti=<span style='text-transform:uppercase'>{Ti}</span>

Ti=Indemnification Agreement

This.sec=THIS {Doc.Ti} (the “{DefT.Agreement}”) is made and entered into as of {EffectiveDate.YMD} between {Company.Name.Full}, a Delaware corporation (the “{DefT.Company}”), and {Party.Name.Full} (“{DefT.Indemnitee}”).

EffectiveDate.YMD={ClosingDate.YMD}

Why.Ti=WITNESSETH THAT:

Why.1.sec=WHEREAS, highly competent persons have become more reluctant to serve corporations as [directors] [officers] or in other capacities unless they are provided with adequate protection through insurance or adequate indemnification against inordinate risks of claims and actions against them arising out of their service to and activities on behalf of the corporation;

Why.2.0.sec=WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the “{DefT.Board}”) has determined that, in order to attract and retain qualified individuals, the Company will attempt to maintain on an ongoing basis, at its sole expense, liability insurance to protect persons serving the Company and its subsidiaries from certain liabilities.

Why.2.1.sec=Although the furnishing of such insurance has been a customary and widespread practice among United States-based corporations and other business enterprises, the Company believes that, given current market conditions and trends, such insurance may be available to it in the future only at higher premiums and with more exclusions.

Why.2.2.sec=At the same time, directors, officers, and other persons in service to corporations or business enterprises are being increasingly subjected to expensive and time-consuming litigation relating to, among other things, matters that traditionally would have been brought only against the Company or business enterprise itself.

Optional:

Why.2.3.sec=The {Indemnity.ProvidedBy.Bylaws/Bylaws_and_COI?} of the Company require indemnification of the officers and directors of the Company.

Bylaws=Bylaws

Bylaws_and_COI=Bylaws and Certificate of Incorporation

Why.2.4.sec=Indemnitee may also be entitled to indemnification pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (“{DefT.DGCL}”).

Why.2.5.sec=The {Indemnity.ProvidedBy.Bylaws/Bylaws_and_COI?} and the DGCL expressly provide that the indemnification provisions set forth therein are not exclusive, and thereby contemplate that contracts may be entered into between the Company and members of the Board, officers and other persons with respect to indemnification;

Why.2.=[G/Z/para/s5]

Why.3.sec=WHEREAS, the uncertainties relating to such insurance and to indemnification have increased the difficulty of attracting and retaining such persons;

Why.4.sec=WHEREAS, the Board has determined that the increased difficulty in attracting and retaining such persons is detrimental to the best interests of the Company’s stockholders and that the Company should act to assure such persons that there will be increased certainty of such protection in the future;

Why.5.sec=WHEREAS, it is reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Company contractually to obligate itself to indemnify, and to advance expenses on behalf of, such persons to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law so that they will serve or continue to serve the Company free from undue concern that they will not be so indemnified; 

Why.6.sec=WHEREAS, this Agreement is a supplement to and in furtherance of the {Indemnity.ProvidedBy.Bylaws/Bylaws_and_COI?} of the Company and any resolutions adopted pursuant thereto, and shall not be deemed a substitute therefor, nor to diminish or abrogate any rights of Indemnitee thereunder; and

Why.7.sec=WHEREAS, Indemnitee does not regard the protection available under the Company’s {Indemnity.ProvidedBy.Bylaws/Bylaws_and_COI?} and insurance as adequate in the present circumstances, and may not be willing to serve as an officer or director without adequate protection, and the Company desires Indemnitee to serve in such capacity.  Indemnitee is willing to serve, continue to serve and to take on additional service for or on behalf of the Company on the condition that he or she be so indemnified; and

Why.8.sec=WHEREAS, Indemnitee has certain rights to indemnification and/or insurance provided by {OtherIndemnitor.Name.Full} which Indemnitee and {OtherIndemnitor.Name.Full} intend to be secondary to the primary obligation of the Company to indemnify Indemnitee as provided herein, with the Company’s acknowledgement and agreement to the foregoing being a material condition to Indemnitee’s willingness to serve on the Board.

Why.=[G/Z/ol-none/s8]

That.sec=NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of Indemnitee’s agreement to serve as an [officer] [director] from and after the date hereof, the parties hereto agree as follows:

IndemnifyIndemnitee.Ti=Indemnity of Indemnitee

IndemnifyIndemnitee.0.sec=The Company hereby agrees to hold harmless and indemnify Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by law, as such may be amended from time to time.  In furtherance of the foregoing indemnification, and without limiting the generality thereof:

[Comment:  Sections 1 and 2 of the agreement contain the basic indemnification obligations of the agreement.  Section 1 provides for indemnification that essentially tracks Section 145, while Section 2 provides for broader indemnification (e.g., by providing for indemnification of judgments, penalties and amounts paid in settlement of derivative actions).  The overlap in coverage of the two (2) sections is intentional.  Indemnification under Section 1 is designed to be available even if a Delaware court does not allow indemnification under Section 2 in a particular instance.  

Section 1 essentially requires indemnification to the fullest extent permitted or required under Section 145.  Thus, Section 1 makes mandatory indemnification that is permissive under Sections 145(a) and (b).  Note that Section 1 does not make mandatory a determination under Section 145(d) that the applicable standard of conduct has been satisfied.  Therefore, even though mandatory, indemnification under Sections 1(a) and (b) is subject to a determination under Section 145(d) and Section 6(b) that the applicable standard has been satisfied.]


IndemnifyIndemnitee.ClaimsByOthers.Ti=Proceedings Other Than Proceedings by or in the Right of the Company.  

IndemnifyIndemnitee.ClaimsByOthers.sec=Indemnitee shall be entitled to the rights of indemnification provided in this Section {IndemnifyIndemnitee.ClaimsByOthers.Xnum} if, by reason of his or her Corporate Status (as hereinafter defined), the Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or participant in any Proceeding (as hereinafter defined) other than a Proceeding by or in the right of the Company.  Pursuant to this Section {IndemnifyIndemnitee.ClaimsByOthers.Xnum}, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses (as hereinafter defined), judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her, or on his or her behalf, in connection with such Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein, if the Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and with respect to any criminal Proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the Indemnitee’s conduct was unlawful.

IndemnifyIndemnitee.ClaimsByOthers.=[G/Z/Base]

IndemnifyIndemnitee.ClaimsByCompany.Ti=Proceedings by or in the Right of the Company

IndemnifyIndemnitee.ClaimsByCompany.sec=Indemnitee shall be entitled to the rights of indemnification provided in this Section {IndemnifyIndemnitee.ClaimsByCompany.Xnum} if, by reason of his or her Corporate Status, the Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or participant in any Proceeding brought by or in the right of the Company.  Pursuant to this Section {IndemnifyIndemnitee.ClaimsByCompany.Xnum}, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee, or on the Indemnitee’s behalf, in connection with such Proceeding if the Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company; provided, however, if applicable law so provides, no indemnification against such Expenses shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter in such Proceeding as to which Indemnitee shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Company unless and to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall determine that such indemnification may be made.

IndemnifyIndemnitee.ClaimsByCompany.=[G/Z/Base]

[Comment:  Section 145(b) permits indemnification of directors, officers, employees and agents for attorneys’ fees and other expenses in derivative actions but not for judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement of such actions.  However, in a proceeding where the individual is adjudged to be liable to the corporation, Section 145(b) does not permit indemnification even for expenses unless and to the extent that an appropriate court determines that, in view of all the circumstances, the individual is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification for such expenses.  Thus, indemnification for derivative actions is significantly more limited than for third-party actions.  The rationale for this distinction is that any liability in a derivative action is to make the corporation (on whose behalf the action was brought) whole for harm it suffered, and the corporation would not receive any benefit by indemnifying an individual against such liability.  In effect, the corporation would be returning funds to the person liable to pay them.  As with Section {IndemnifyIndemnitee.ClaimsByOthers.Xnum}, Section {IndemnifyIndemnitee.ClaimsByCompany.Xnum} essentially tracks Section 145(b), except that it makes indemnification mandatory rather than permissible.

Note that by eliminating or limiting a director’s exposure to financial liability for breaches of certain classes of fiduciary duties, Section 102(b)(7) may reduce exposure for claims that would otherwise result in derivative actions and thereby overcome some of the limitations on indemnification in Section 145(b).]

IndemnifyIndemnitee.IfSuccessful.Ti=Indemnification for Expenses of a Party Who is Wholly or Partly Successful

IndemnifyIndemnitee.IfSuccessful.sec=Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee is, by reason of his or her Corporate Status, a party to (or participant in) and is successful, on the merits or otherwise, in any Proceeding, he or she shall be indemnified to the maximum extent permitted by law, as such may be amended from time to time, against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or her, or on his or her behalf, in connection therewith.  If Indemnitee is not wholly successful in such Proceeding but is successful, on the merits or otherwise, as to one (1) or more but less than all claims, issues or matters in such Proceeding, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or her, or on his or her behalf, in connection with each successfully resolved claim, issue or matter.  For purposes of this Section and without limitation, the termination of any claim, issue or matter in such a Proceeding by dismissal, with or without prejudice, shall be deemed to be a successful result as to such claim, issue or matter.

IndemnifyIndemnitee.AppointingStockholder.2.2.sec=terminate on an initial public offering of the Company’s Common Stock;

The only limitation that shall exist upon the Company’s obligations pursuant to this Agreement shall be that the Company shall not be obligated to make any payment to Indemnitee that is finally determined (under the procedures, and subject to the presumptions, set forth in Sections {Procedure-Presumption.Xnum} and {IndemniteeRemedy.Xnum} hereof) to be unlawful.

AdditionalIndemnity.=[G/Z/Base]

Xplain.=[G/NVCA/2020/Indemn/Xplain/Indemnity.md]

Contribution.Ti=Contribution

[Comment:  The provisions regarding contribution are primarily intended to provide an alternative means of protecting individuals from liability for some types of federal securities law violations where indemnification is unenforceable for public policy reasons.  For example, Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act explicitly recognizes contribution in cases where one (1) or more persons are or may be subject to the same liability under Section 11, even though the SEC takes the position that indemnification for Section 11 violations is contrary to public policy.]

Contribution.Full.sec=Whether or not the indemnification provided in Sections 1 and 2 hereof is available, in respect of any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding in which the Company is jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such action, suit or proceeding), the Company shall pay, in the first instance, the entire amount of any judgment or settlement of such action, suit or proceeding without requiring Indemnitee to contribute to such payment and the Company hereby waives and relinquishes any right of contribution it may have against Indemnitee.  The Company shall not enter into any settlement of any action, suit or proceeding in which the Company is jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such action, suit or proceeding) unless such settlement provides for a full and final release of all claims asserted against Indemnitee.

[Comment:  Section 3(a), in effect, provides that where the corporation and the individual are jointly liable (or if joined, would be), the corporation shall contribute 100% of the liability, and the individual would not be required to contribute anything.  Section 3(a) also prohibits the corporation from entering into any settlement that does not completely release the individual.]

Contribution.Proportionate.sec=Without diminishing or impairing the obligations of the Company set forth in the preceding subparagraph, if, for any reason, Indemnitee shall elect or be required to pay all or any portion of any judgment or settlement in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding in which the Company is jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such action, suit or proceeding), the Company shall contribute to the amount of Expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred and paid or payable by Indemnitee in proportion to the relative benefits received by the Company and all officers, directors or employees of the Company, other than Indemnitee, who are jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such action, suit or proceeding), on the one hand, and Indemnitee, on the other hand, from the transaction or events from which such action, suit or proceeding arose; provided, however, that the proportion determined on the basis of relative benefit may, to the extent necessary to conform to law, be further adjusted by reference to the relative fault of the Company and all officers, directors or employees of the Company other than Indemnitee who are jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such action, suit or proceeding), on the one hand, and Indemnitee, on the other hand, in connection with the transaction or events that resulted in such expenses, judgments, fines or settlement amounts, as well as any other equitable considerations which applicable law may require to be considered.  The relative fault of the Company and all officers, directors or employees of the Company, other than Indemnitee, who are jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such action, suit or proceeding), on the one hand, and Indemnitee, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, the degree to which their actions were motivated by intent to gain personal profit or advantage, the degree to which their liability is primary or secondary and the degree to which their conduct is active or passive.

[Comment:  Section 3(b) provides an alternative method of allocating the amount contributed by the corporation and the individual in the event that the method of allocation in Section 3(a) (i.e., 100% payment by the corporation) is not enforceable.  In particular, Section 3(b) provides for allocation based on the relative benefits received from the transaction giving rise to liability, and if required to conform to law, the relative fault of the parties.]

Contribution.PeerClaims.sec=The Company hereby agrees to fully indemnify and hold Indemnitee harmless from any claims of contribution which may be brought by officers, directors, or employees of the Company, other than Indemnitee, who may be jointly liable with Indemnitee.

[Comment:  Section 3(c) attempts to indemnify the indemnitee against contribution sought from other third parties.]

Contribution.IfCompanyBenefit.sec=To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, if the indemnification provided for in this Agreement is unavailable to Indemnitee for any reason whatsoever, the Company, in lieu of indemnifying Indemnitee, shall contribute to the amount incurred by Indemnitee, whether for judgments, fines, penalties, excise taxes, amounts paid or to be paid in settlement and/or for Expenses, in connection with any claim relating to an indemnifiable event under this Agreement, in such proportion as is deemed fair and reasonable in light of all of the circumstances of such Proceeding in order to reflect (i) the relative benefits received by the Company and Indemnitee as a result of the event(s) and/or transaction(s) giving cause to such Proceeding and/or (ii) the relative fault of the Company (and its directors, officers, employees and agents) and Indemnitee in connection with such event(s) and/or transaction(s).

[Comment:  Section 3(d) provides for contribution by the Company even if the Company is not held jointly liable based on the relative benefit to the Company of the conduct of the indemnitee giving rise to the loss or expenses incurred by the indemnitee and/or the relative fault of the Company and the indemnitee in connection with the matter in question.]

Contribution.=[G/Z/ol-a/s4]

WitnessExpense.Ti=Indemnification for Expenses of a Witness

WitnessExpense.sec=Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee is, by reason of his or her Corporate Status, a witness, or is made (or asked) to respond to discovery requests, in any Proceeding to which Indemnitee is not a party, he or she shall be indemnified against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or her, or on his or her behalf, in connection therewith.

WitnessExpense.=[G/Z/Base]

[Comment:  Section 4 indemnifies individuals for costs and expenses in serving as a witness in any proceeding relating to such person’s service to the corporation.]

ExpenseAdvance.Ti=Advancement of Expenses

ExpenseAdvance.sec=Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company shall advance all Expenses incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding by reason of Indemnitee’s Corporate Status within thirty (30) days after the receipt by the Company of a statement or statements from Indemnitee requesting such advance or advances from time to time, whether prior to or after final disposition of such Proceeding.  Such statement or statements shall reasonably evidence the Expenses incurred by Indemnitee and shall include or be preceded or accompanied by a written undertaking by or on behalf of Indemnitee to repay any Expenses advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified against such Expenses.  Any advances and undertakings to repay pursuant to this Section {ExpenseAdvance.Xnum} shall be unsecured and interest free.  This Section {ExpenseAdvance.Xnum} shall not apply to any claim made by Indemnitee for which indemnity is excluded pursuant to Section {IndemnityException.Xnum}.

ExpenseAdvance.=[G/Z/Base]

[Comment:  As noted above, Section 145(e) provides for the advancement of attorney’s fees and other expenses to officers and directors in connection with any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative proceeding.  Section 145(e) conditions any advance upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it is ultimately determined that such individual is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation.

Section 5 is modeled after Section 145(e), except that it makes the corporation’s duty to advance expenses mandatory rather than permissive.  Section 5 also supplements Section 145(e) in various respects.  Section 5 requires payment within thirty (30) days after receipt of a request for advancement (provided the request includes a statement of the expenses and an undertaking to repay any advance expenses if it is determined that the indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification against such expenses).  Section 5 also provides that the Company is not required to advance expenses to the Indemnitee for claims for which indemnification is not permitted pursuant to this Agreement.

As an alternative to requiring a separate undertaking from Indemnitee, the Agreement could provide that the execution and delivery of the Agreement itself constitutes the required undertaking by including the following language:  “The Indemnitee shall qualify for advances upon the execution and delivery to the Company of this Agreement, which shall constitute an undertaking providing that the Indemnitee undertakes to repay the amounts advanced (without interest) by the Company pursuant to this Section 5, if and only to the extent that it is ultimately determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company.  No other form of undertaking shall be required other than the execution of this Agreement.”]

Procedure-Presumption.Ti=Procedures and Presumptions for Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification

Procedure-Presumption.0.sec=It is the intent of this Agreement to secure for Indemnitee rights of indemnity that are as favorable as may be permitted under the DGCL and public policy of the State of Delaware.  Accordingly, the parties agree that the following procedures and presumptions shall apply in the event of any question as to whether Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement:

[Comment:  Section 6 specifies policies and procedures to be applied in determining whether an individual is entitled to indemnification under the Agreement.  As with other provisions of the agreement, these policies and procedures are not specifically authorized by Section 145.  As a result, the rights and procedures specified in Section 6 may be unenforceable.  See the comment under Section 2 of the Agreement above.  Note, however, that unlike indemnification agreements customarily entered into in financings (e.g., between the issuer and underwriters in an underwritten public offering), this Agreement (and most indemnification agreements) do not delineate defense procedures.]

Procedure-Presumption.DemandByIndemnitee.sec=To obtain indemnification under this Agreement, Indemnitee shall submit to the Company a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification.  The Secretary of the Company shall, promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification, advise the Board in writing that Indemnitee has requested indemnification.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any failure of Indemnitee to provide such a request to the Company, or to provide such a request in a timely fashion, shall not relieve the Company of any liability that it may have to Indemnitee unless, and to the extent that, such failure actually and materially prejudices the interests of the Company.  The Company will be entitled to participate in the Proceeding at its own Expense.

Procedure-Presumption.DemandByIndemnitee.=[G/Z/Base]

Procedure-Presumption.Determination.1.0.sec=Upon written request by Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to the first sentence of Section {Procedure-Presumption.DemandByIndemnitee.Xnum} hereof, a determination with respect to Indemnitee’s entitlement thereto shall be made in the specific case by one of the following four methods, which shall be at the election of the Board:

Procedure-Presumption.Determination.1.1.sec=by a majority vote of the disinterested directors, even though less than a quorum,

Procedure-Presumption.Determination.1.2.sec=by a committee of disinterested directors designated by a majority vote of the disinterested directors, even though less than a quorum,

Procedure-Presumption.Determination.1.3.sec=if there are no disinterested directors or if the disinterested directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to the Indemnitee, or

Procedure-Presumption.Determination.1.4.sec=if so directed by the Board, by the stockholders of the Company.

Procedure-Presumption.Determination.1.=[G/Z/ol-i/s4]

Procedure-Presumption.Determination.2.sec=For purposes hereof, disinterested directors are those members of the Board who are not parties to the action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification is sought by Indemnitee.

Procedure-Presumption.Determination.=[G/Z/para/s2]

[Comment:  As noted above, Section 145(e) provides that indemnification under Sections 145(a) and (b) must be authorized on a case-by-case basis (unless ordered by a court) in accordance with a statutorily mandated decision making process.  The determination that must be made in each case is whether indemnification is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth Section 145(a) or (b).  Such determination may be made (i) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to the proceeding, (ii) by a committee of such directors, (iii) by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (iv) by the stockholders.

There are a number of practical problems in making a determination pursuant to Section 145(d).  First, many actions that give rise to indemnification claims will be brought against all directors and therefore preclude a determination by majority vote of disinterested directors.  One solution might be to appoint additional disinterested directors to make a determination, although this course of action may present its own difficulties.  Second, many corporations and directors will be reluctant to use the alternative of seeking stockholder approval, particularly for publicly held corporations where the approval process would be difficult and widely publicized.  Third, the term “independent legal counsel” is not defined in Section 145 or applicable case law, and even if a well-established definition existed, a number of issues would arise in rendering a required opinion should experienced counsel agree to consider doing so.

Section 6(b) allows the board to select the method of determination.  Some agreements for public companies provide that independent counsel make the determination following a change in control (presumably on the theory that directors and stockholders after a change in control may be less inclined to act impartially) and allow the Company to select the method of determination otherwise.  Other agreements purport to vest this authority in the Indemnitee, but such a provision could be challenged as an unlawful delegation of the board’s responsibility to manage the business and affairs of the corporation under Section 141(a) of the DGCL.  

For a public company where it is desired to provide that following a change of control the indemnification determination would be made by independent counsel, an example of a typical “change of control” definition follows:

Example.Def.Change_in_Control.0.sec=A “{DefT.Change_in_Control}” shall be deemed to occur upon the earliest to occur after the date of this Agreement of any of the following events:

Example.Def.Change_in_Control.1.Ti=Acquisition of Stock by Third Party

Procedure-Presumption.IndependentCounsel.sec=If the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section {Procedure-Presumption.Determination.Xnum} hereof, the Independent Counsel shall be selected as provided in this Section {Procedure-Presumption.IndependentCounsel.Xnum}.  The Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Board.  Indemnitee may, within ten (10) days after such written notice of selection shall have been given, deliver to the Company a written objection to such selection; provided, however, that such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel so selected does not meet the requirements of “{DefT.Independent_Counsel}” as defined in Section {Def.Xnum} of this Agreement, and the objection shall set forth with particularity the factual basis of such assertion.  Absent a proper and timely objection, the person so selected shall act as Independent Counsel.  If a written objection is made and substantiated, the Independent Counsel selected may not serve as Independent Counsel unless and until such objection is withdrawn or a court has determined that such objection is without merit.  If, within twenty (20) days after submission by Indemnitee of a written request for indemnification pursuant to Section {Procedure-Presumption.DemandByIndemnitee.Xnum} hereof, no Independent Counsel shall have been selected and not objected to, either the Company or Indemnitee may petition the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or other court of competent jurisdiction for resolution of any objection which shall have been made by the Indemnitee to the Company’s selection of Independent Counsel and/or for the appointment as Independent Counsel of a person selected by the court or by such other person as the court shall designate, and the person with respect to whom all objections are so resolved or the person so appointed shall act as Independent Counsel under Section {Procedure-Presumption.Determination.Xnum} hereof.

Procedure-Presumption.IndependentCounsel.=[G/Z/Base]

[Comment:  Sections 6(c) through (g) specify procedures and presumptions that apply in making a determination of entitlement to indemnification.  Section 6(c) gives the Board the right to select independent legal counsel, subject to an objection procedure.  Some public company agreements vest the ability to select the Independent Counsel in the Indemnitee after a change of control; but such a provision could be challenged as an unlawful delegation of the board’s responsibility to manage the business and affairs of the corporation under Section 141(a) of the DGCL.  Section 6(d) below creates a presumption that the indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, allocates the burden of proof to the party seeking to overcome the presumption and specifies an applicable standard of proof.  Section 6(e), among other things, creates a presumption that the indemnitee acted in accordance with the standard of conduct required for indemnification, allocates the burden of proof to the party seeking to overcome the presumption, specifies the applicable standard of proof and specifies circumstances under which the indemnitee is deemed to have acted in good faith.  Section 6(f) below provides for a determination of entitlement if no determination is made by the decision-maker within sixty (60) days after a request for determination (plus a thirty (30) day extension right) subject to certain conditions.  Section 6(g) below requires the indemnitee to cooperate with the person or persons making the determination, requires such person or persons to act reasonably and in good faith and requires the corporation to pay certain costs associated with making the determination.

Procedure-Presumption.Presumption.sec=In making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification hereunder, the person or persons or entity making such determination shall presume that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement.  Anyone seeking to overcome this presumption shall have the burden of proof and the burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence.  Neither the failure of the Company (including by its directors or independent legal counsel) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of any action pursuant to this Agreement that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Company (including by its directors or independent legal counsel) that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

Procedure-Presumption.Presumption.=[G/Z/Base]

[Comment:  Indemnification agreements may be subject to review by state securities law administrators if the corporation’s securities are registered or qualified in their state.  For example, the California Department of Corporations has objected to shifting the burden of proof as provided in this Section 6(d).  In one instance, a corporation was required to renegotiate indemnification agreements with its directors to eliminate a similar provision before qualifying an issuance of securities in California.]

Procedure-Presumption.GoodFaith.sec=Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in good faith if Indemnitee’s action is based on the records or books of account of the Enterprise (as hereinafter defined), including financial statements, or on information supplied to Indemnitee by the officers of the Enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to the Enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care by the Enterprise.  The provisions of this Section {Procedure-Presumption.GoodFaith.Xnum} shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the other circumstances in which the Indemnitee may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this Agreement.  In addition, the knowledge and/or actions, or failure to act, of any director, officer, agent or employee of the Enterprise shall not be imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right to indemnification under this Agreement.  Whether or not the foregoing provisions of this Section {Procedure-Presumption.GoodFaith.Xnum} are satisfied, it shall in any event be presumed that Indemnitee has at all times acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company.  Anyone seeking to overcome this presumption shall have the burden of proof and the burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence.

Procedure-Presumption.DeadlineForDetermination.0.sec=If the person, persons or entity empowered or selected under Section {Procedure-Presumption.Xnum} to determine whether Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification shall not have made a determination within sixty (60) days after receipt by the Company of the request therefor, the requisite determination of entitlement to indemnification shall be deemed to have been made and Indemnitee shall be entitled to such indemnification absent 
Procedure-Presumption.DeadlineForDetermination.1.sec=a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee’s statement not materially misleading, in connection with the request for indemnification, or

Procedure-Presumption.DeadlineForDetermination.2.sec=a prohibition of such indemnification under applicable law; 

Procedure-Presumption.DeadlineForDetermination.00.1.sec=provided, however, that such sixty (60) day period may be extended for a reasonable time, not to exceed an additional thirty (30) days, if the person, persons or entity making such determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification in good faith requires such additional time to obtain or evaluate documentation and/or information relating thereto; and 

Procedure-Presumption.DeadlineForDetermination.00.2.0.sec=provided further, that the foregoing provisions of this Section {Procedure-Presumption.DeadlineForDetermination.Xnum} shall not apply

Procedure-Presumption.DeadlineForDetermination.00.2.1.sec=if the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by the stockholders pursuant to Section {Procedure-Presumption.Determination.Xnum} of this Agreement and

Procedure-Presumption.DeadlineForDetermination.00.2.2.1.sec=within fifteen (15) days after receipt by the Company of the request for such determination, the Board or the Disinterested Directors, if appropriate, resolve to submit such determination to the stockholders for their consideration at an annual meeting thereof to be held within seventy five (75) days after such receipt and such determination is made thereat, or

Procedure-Presumption.DeadlineForDetermination.00.2.2.2.sec=a special meeting of stockholders is called within fifteen (15) days after such receipt for the purpose of making such determination, such meeting is held for such purpose within sixty (60) days after having been so called and such determination is made thereat.

Procedure-Presumption.IndemniteeCooperation.sec=Indemnitee shall cooperate with the person, persons or entity making such determination with respect to Indemnitee’s entitlement to indemnification, including providing to such person, persons or entity upon reasonable advance request any documentation or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination.  Any Independent Counsel, member of the Board or stockholder of the Company shall act reasonably and in good faith in making a determination regarding the Indemnitee’s entitlement to indemnification under this Agreement.  Any costs or expenses (including attorneys’ fees and disbursements) incurred by Indemnitee in so cooperating with the person, persons or entity making such determination shall be borne by the Company (irrespective of the determination as to Indemnitee’s entitlement to indemnification) and the Company hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold Indemnitee harmless therefrom.

Procedure-Presumption.IndemniteeCooperation.=[G/Z/Base]

Procedure-Presumption.AbsenceOfAdverseJudgment.sec=In the event that any action, suit or proceeding to which Indemnitee is a party is resolved in any manner other than by adverse judgment against Indemnitee (including, without limitation, settlement of such action, suit or proceeding with or without payment of money or other consideration) it shall be presumed that Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in such action, suit or proceeding.  Anyone seeking to overcome this presumption shall have the burden of proof and the burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence.

Procedure-Presumption.AbsenceOfAdverseJudgment.=[G/Z/Base]

[Comment:  Section 6(h) creates a presumption that any resolution of a claim other than by adverse judgment against the Indemnitee (including a settlement, regardless of whether money is paid) constitutes being “successful on the merits or otherwise” for purposes of Section 145(c).  Section 6(h) also allocates the burden of proof to the party seeking to overcome the presumption and specifies the standard of proof in overcoming the presumption.  If enforceable, this provision is particularly helpful because it would allow for mandatory indemnification pursuant to Section 145(c).]

Procedure-Presumption.AdverseJudgment.sec=The termination of any Proceeding or of any claim, issue or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not (except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement) of itself adversely affect the right of Indemnitee to indemnification or create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company or, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, that Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.

The Company shall not oppose Indemnitee’s right to seek any such adjudication.

[Comment:  Section 7(a) provides for a right of adjudication before a Delaware court in the event of certain adverse results under the Agreement.  Some indemnification agreements also provide that Indemnitee, at his or her option, may seek an award in arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.]

IndemniteeRemedy.2.sec=In the event that a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section {Procedure-Presumption.Determination.Xnum} of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to this Section {IndemniteeRemedy.Xnum} shall be conducted in all respects as a de novo trial on the merits, and Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of the adverse determination under Section {Procedure-Presumption.Determination.Xnum}.

[Comment:  Sections 7(b) through 7(e) seek to extend statutory indemnification rights pursuant to Section 145(f).]

IndemniteeRemedy.3.sec=If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section {Procedure-Presumption.Determination.Xnum} of this Agreement that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to this Section {IndemniteeRemedy.Xnum}, absent (i) a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee’s misstatement not materially misleading in connection with the application for indemnification, or (ii) a prohibition of such indemnification under applicable law.

IndemniteeRemedy.5.sec=The Company shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to this Section {IndemniteeRemedy.Xnum} that the procedures and presumptions of this Agreement are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court that the Company is bound by all the provisions of this Agreement.  It is the intent of the Company that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Indemnitee not be required to incur legal fees or other Expenses associated with the interpretation, enforcement or defense of Indemnitee’s rights under this Agreement by litigation or otherwise because the cost and expense thereof would substantially detract from the benefits intended to be extended to the Indemnitee hereunder.  The Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against any and all Expenses and, if requested by Indemnitee, shall (within ten (10) days after receipt by the Company of a written request therefore) advance, to the extent not prohibited by law, such expenses to Indemnitee, which are incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any action brought by Indemnitee for indemnification or advance of Expenses from the Company under this Agreement or under any directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies maintained by the Company, if, in the case of indemnification, Indemnitee is wholly successful on the underlying claims; if Indemnitee is not wholly successful on the underlying claims, then such indemnification shall be only to the extent Indemnitee is successful on such underlying claims or otherwise as permitted by law, whichever is greater.

No amendment, alteration or repeal of this Agreement or of any provision hereof shall limit or restrict any right of Indemnitee under this Agreement in respect of any action taken or omitted by such Indemnitee in his or her Corporate Status prior to such amendment, alteration or repeal.  To the extent that a change in the DGCL, whether by statute or judicial decision, permits greater indemnification than would be afforded currently under the Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws and this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties hereto that Indemnitee shall enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by such change.  No right or remedy herein conferred is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every other right and remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise.  The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other right or remedy.

Subrogation.2.sec=To the extent that the Company maintains an insurance policy or policies providing liability insurance for directors, officers, employees, or agents or fiduciaries of the Company or of any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise that such person serves at the request of the Company, Indemnitee shall be covered by such policy or policies in accordance with its or their terms to the maximum extent of the coverage available for any director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary under such policy or policies.  If, at the time of the receipt of a notice of a claim pursuant to the terms hereof, the Company has directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in effect, the Company shall give prompt notice of the commencement of such proceeding to the insurers in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies.  The Company shall thereafter take all necessary or desirable action to cause such insurers to pay, on behalf of the Indemnitee, all amounts payable as a result of such proceeding in accordance with the terms of such policies.

[Comment:  Some indemnification agreements require the corporation to obtain (or use commercially reasonable or best efforts to obtain) D&O insurance with specified policy limits or other terms.  Instead, this agreement requires the corporation to furnish the Indemnitee with the maximum level of D&O insurance coverage provided to other like parties.]

Subrogation.3.4.sec=The Company and Indemnitee agree that the Fund Indemnitors are express third party beneficiaries of the terms of this Section {Subrogation.3.Xnum}.

Subrogation.3.=[G/Z/para/s4]

[Comment: This provision is intended to be used for directors appointed by investment funds to address the ruling in Levy et al. v. HLI Operating Company, Inc., 2007 WL 1500032 (Del. Ch. May 16, 2007), which held that investment funds providing indemnification to their partners who serve on boards of fund portfolio companies are co-indemnitors with the portfolio company and, therefore, are not entitled to recover from the portfolio company the full amount of any payments advanced on behalf of the partner-director.  Rather, the fund only has a claim for contribution to the extent it advanced more than its fair share.  In the absence of a provision such as the above, it is possible the Levy case will be broadly construed to obligate a fund providing such indemnification to contribute its share of any payments made by any other party providing like indemnification to its director designees.]

Subrogation.4.sec=Except as provided in paragraph {Subrogation.3.Xnum} above, in the event of any payment under this Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee (other than against the Fund Indemnitors), who shall execute all papers required and take all action necessary to secure such rights, including execution of such documents as are necessary to enable the Company to bring suit to enforce such rights.

Subrogation.5.sec=Except as provided in paragraph {Subrogation.3.Xnum} above, the Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment of amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder if and to the extent that Indemnitee has otherwise actually received such payment under any insurance policy, contract, agreement or otherwise.
