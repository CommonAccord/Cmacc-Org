[Comment:  Section 145(c) requires the corporation to indemnify a director or officer for attorney fees and other expenses actually and reasonably incurred in connection with a proceeding referred to in Sections 145(a) or (b) to the extent that the indemnitee is “successful on the merits or otherwise.”  In other words, an indemnitee is entitled to indemnification for reasonable expenses to the extent successful on the merits, even if the indemnitee is successful for “technical” reasons and without the need for a determination as to whether the director or officer met the applicable standard of conduct.  Section 1(c) essentially tracks Section 145(c).  Prior to the 2020 amendments to the DGCL, Section 145(c) did not define the “officers” to whom mandatory indemnification under Section 145(c) must be provided.  Pursuant to the 2020 amendments to the DGCL, for indemnification with respect to any act or omission occurring after December 31, 2020, references to an “officer” for purposes of Section 145(c), shall mean only a person who at the time of such act or omission is deemed to have consented to service by the delivery of process to the registered agent of the corporation pursuant to Section 3114(b) of title 10 of the Delaware Code.  Thus, by reference to Section 3114(b), the “officers” entitled to mandatory indemnification under Section 145(c) are (i) the president, chief executive officer, chief operating officer, chief financial officer, chief legal officer, controller, treasurer or chief accounting officer, (ii) any individual identified in public filings as one of the most highly compensated officers of the corporation or (iii) any individual who, by written agreement with the corporation, has consented to be identified as an officer for purposes of Section 3114(b).  The 2020 amendments also added a new subsection (Section 145(c)(2)), which allows for the extension of mandatory indemnification of expenses under Section 145(c) to persons other than Section 3114(b) officers.  As a result, new subsection 145(c)(2) permits a corporation to provide mandatory indemnification under Section 145(c) to officers who are not Section 3114(b) officers.  With respect to acts or omissions occurring before December 31, 2020, officers who are not Section 3114(b) officers should remain entitled to the statutory protection under Section 145(c).]
