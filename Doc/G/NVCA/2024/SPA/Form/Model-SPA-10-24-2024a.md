Generally this agreement does not set forth either (1) the characteristics of the stock being sold (which are defined in the Certificate of Incorporation) or (2) the relationship among the parties after the closing, such as registration rights, rights of first refusal and co-sale and voting arrangements (these matters often implicate persons other than just the {_Company} and the investors in this round of financing and are usually embodied in separate agreements to which those others persons are parties, or in some cases in the Certificate of Incorporation). The main items of negotiation in the Stock Purchase {_Agreement} are the representations and warranties that the {_Company} must make to the investors and the closing conditions for the transaction.

FORM OF LEGAL OPINION


1	If only one closing is contemplated, references to “{_Initial_Closing},” “each Closing,” “such Closing,” etc. should be modified. If the transaction has a so-called “simultaneous sign and close” you can update the tense accordingly (“has adopted and filed”).
2	If the {_Agreement} is signed prior to the Closing, this provision gives the parties flexibility to change the closing date as contingencies arise. As a practical matter, however, the {_Agreement} is usually signed on the date of the Closing. This means that, until the Closing, everyone has an opportunity to back out of the deal.
3	If the {_Company} has uncertificated shares, consider revising “a certificate representing” to “a notice of issuance of uncertificated shares (and may, upon written request by such {_Purchaser}, issue and deliver a certificate )”. 
4	If some or all of the {_Purchaser}s will be converting previously issued notes to {_Shares}, consider paying the interest in cash, if the terms of the notes permit this, to avoid last-minute re-computations if the closing is delayed. Note that cancellation of interest in return for stock may be a taxable event in the amount of the interest cancelled. Accordingly, some of the {_Purchaser}s may require payment of interest in cash to avoid imputation of income without the corresponding payment of cash to pay the tax.
5	The {_Company} may have tax reporting and/or withholding obligations in connection with the conversion of Convertible Securities into {_Company} stock. Bracketed language provides a generic mechanism for {_Company} to obtain relevant tax documentation to facilitate the tax analysis and comply with its withholding obligations. Section {1.2.2.Xnum} and this Section {1.3.1.5.Xnum} to be tailored to particular specifics of the Convertible Securities being converted, after input from parties’ tax advisors.
6	Conform to the convertible securities outstanding.
7	Including this provision where there are Safes/notes or similar instruments converting helps ensure that any minor deviations from the formulas (based on rounding, applications of assumptions, etc.) cannot later become an issue. It is recommended that all Safe/note holders sign the financing documents, but this provision (1) speaks only on behalf of the signing holders, and (2) provides for amendment of all convertible securities converting at closing to comply herewith if and to the extent such convertible securities may be amended by some majority and that majority signs. If the instruments require individual consent, it is still beneficial to include this provision, but any safe/note holder that does not sign would not be bound hereby.
8	This Section {1.4.Xnum} is intended to allow the {_Company} to hold an {_Initial_Closing} once it has reached the minimum required to close, and then continue to raise capital over some agreed upon period on the same terms. This should not be confused with a “tranched” financing, where the amount committed to the financing round is not invested all at once up front but rather is invested in pre-specified “tranches,” usually dependent on the achievement of agreed upon milestone(s). 
9	The {_Company} may want to limit this approval right to the lead {_Purchaser}. As an alternative, the {_Agreement} may specify that Additional {_Purchaser}s must be approved by the Board of Directors, including the directors elected by the Series A Preferred stockholders.
10 	*New October 2024* With the effectiveness of the CTA, companies are required to make certain reports around “beneficial owners” – if relevant, this definition will be necessary for Section {2.6.2.Xnum} and possibly elsewhere.  Include if appropriate.
11	See model Indemnification {_Agreement} for discussion of the issue of expanding coverage to include not just VC designee director, but also the fund(s) making the investment. When the fund is also an indemnified party under the indemnification agreement, it may be appropriate for the D&O policy to include an endorsement extending coverage to the fund. 
12	An important point of negotiation is often whether the {_Company} will represent that a given fact (a) is true or (b) is true to the {_Company}’s knowledge. Alternative (a) requires the {_Company} to bear the entire risk of the truth or falsity of the represented fact, regardless of whether the {_Company} knew (or could have known) at the time of the representation whether or not the fact was true. Alternative (b) is preferable from the {_Company}’s standpoint, since it holds the {_Company} responsible only for facts of which it is actually aware. Alternative (b) is also most compatible with the role of diligence and the {_Company}’s representations in venture capital transactions, which is to ensure that venture investors have the best information available regarding their potential investment, rather than to “shift risk” in the manner of an M&A transaction (in other words, venture investors do not expect to sue portfolio companies or their founders for statements made in good faith that later turn out to have been incorrect).
13 	*New October 2024* Typically this would list additional employees, if any, with a reasonably likelihood of having relevant information that don’t otherwise meet the definition of Officer, such as an internal lawyer.
14 	While this list likely encompasses relevant individuals, consider any unique titles or circumstances for the particular company.
15	*Revised October 2024* The purpose of the {_Company}’s representations is primarily to create a mechanism to ensure full disclosure about the {_Company}’s organization, financial condition and business to the investors. The {_Company} is required to list any deviations from, or matters expressly called for by, the representations on a Disclosure Schedule, the preparation and review of which drives the due diligence process on both sides of the deal. For subsequent closings, changes to the Disclosure Schedule are sometimes simply referenced on the Compliance Certificate. The introductory paragraph to this Section {2.Xnum} may be modified to permit an update to the Disclosure Schedule that would be reasonably acceptable to each of the {_Purchaser}s. If this modification is made, a closing condition should be added to indicate that the updated Disclosure Schedule will be delivered and that each of the {_Purchaser}s may refuse to close if the updated Disclosure Schedule reveals anything that has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 
16	The purpose of this representation is to ensure that basic corporate maintenance has been properly carried out by the {_Company}. Note that the {_Company} is required to disclose failure to qualify in other jurisdictions where it does business only if failure to do so could have a “Material Adverse Effect”; the purpose of this language is to eliminate the time and expense of doing a state-by-state analysis to determine whether the {_Company} should technically be qualified. If the {_Company} has material connections to states in which it is not qualified, these states must be investigated by counsel to determine whether qualification is necessary and whether there are potential adverse effects of having failed to qualify.
17	*Revised October 2024* Section {2.2.Xnum} describes the {_Company}’s capital structure and can be stated either immediately prior to or upon the {_Initial_Closing} of the financing. This description details any outstanding rights or privileges with respect to the {_Company}’s securities. In later round financings, this description would also list any preemptive rights, co-sale rights and rights of first refusal granted to investors in prior rounds. 
18	This sentence reduces need to list the Convertible Securities in the Disclosure Schedule that are already being listed in the Schedule of {_Purchaser}s.
19	Rule 506 of Regulation D (“Rule 506”) incudes specific requirements for offerings made in reliance on the exception from registration provided by Rule 506. Those include the absence of “bad actors” and, for offerings involving general solicitation under Rule 506(c), the taking by the issuer of reasonable steps to confirm each purchaser’s accredited investor status.
20	*New October 2024* This representation may not be helpful to {_Purchaser}s and may increase scheduling burden.  
21	It should be noted that the consensus among the NVCA drafting group was that the 409A issues are better dealt with as a diligence item, rather than a {_Company} rep. It is in any case important that the issue be surfaced as part of the financing, to ensure that the {_Company} is mindful of the obligations and potential penalties imposed by 409A as it makes future equity grants. Prior versions of this model agreement included the following optional representation, if {_Purchaser}s feel it important to include: “409A. The {_Company} believes in good faith that any “nonqualified deferred compensation plan” (as such term is defined under Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code and the guidance thereunder) under which the {_Company} makes, is obligated to make or promises to make, payments (each, a “409A Plan”) complies in all material respects, in both form and operation, with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the guidance thereunder. To the knowledge of the {_Company}, no payment to be made under any 409A Plan is, or will be, subject to the penalties of Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code. 
22	*Revised October 2024* The purpose of this representation is to require the {_Company} to fully disclose its structure, including other entities, if any, that it controls.
23	The representations in Sections 2.4 and 2.5 are intended to ensure that the {_Company} has taken all steps necessary to issue the preferred stock in accordance with applicable corporate law. This means that, before the closing, the {_Company} must (A) obtain the requisite stockholder and board approvals to amend the Certificate of Incorporation and issue the stock; (B) file the {_Restated_Certificate}; and (C) obtain any other stockholder consents or waivers required pursuant to the {_Restated_Certificate}, Bylaws, and existing agreements with securityholders (most importantly, waivers to any existing rights of first offer or refusal). Section 2.5 also requires the {_Company} to disclose any restrictions on transfer other than those contained in the Transaction {_Agreement}s (such as any contained in the {_Restated_Certificate} and Bylaws, or any preemptive rights contained in agreements with other securityholders).
24 *New October 2024* In a simultaneous sign and close, (i) would not be necessary, as the charter would need to be on file before the SPA is deemed signed.
25 *New October 2024* Include if a new or amended beneficial ownership information report will be necessitated by the closing.
26	The litigation representation will often be unqualified in Series A financings. The bracketed materiality qualifiers are more common in later rounds of financings. In subsequent rounds it is no longer appropriate to have the {_Company} make representations regarding directors (as opposed to employees), since directors will include investor representatives. 
27	It may be appropriate to include a knowledge qualifier as to investigations since it would be difficult for the {_Company} to know of an investigation unless it had been notified. Some investors nevertheless feel the risk is appropriately borne by the {_Company}.
28	Section {2.8.1..Xnum} and Section {2.8.2.Xnum} give the {_Purchaser}s assurances that the {_Company} has the intellectual property rights necessary to conduct its business, or that the {_Company} has disclosed its need to acquire further rights. This model agreement includes options for (i) knowledge-qualifying the entire representation or (ii) knowledge-qualifying solely as to patents and trademarks, on the theory that potential patent conflicts cannot always be uncovered even after reasonable investigation. 
29	If the investor has indicated that specific patents or other registered IP are critically important to the success of the {_Company}, consider adding a validity and enforceability rep along the lines of the following: “To the {_Company}’s knowledge, [specified patent(s)] (the “Specified Patents”) (excluding applications) is valid and enforceable. The {_Company} has not received any notice disputing the inventorship or ownership or the validity or enforceability of the Specified Patents, and to the {_Company}’s knowledge there are no circumstances that would reasonably support such a claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this paragraph does not require the disclosure of any non-final notice or correspondence from the registering entity issued in the course of the prosecution of an application.” 
30	The limitation that the services not be incorporated into the {_Company}’s products or services may not be appropriate for a cloud services company relying heavily on third party integrations or vendors; on the other hand, investors may want to review any such contracts in that situation if the {_Company}’s business is dependent on them. 
31	In certain circumstances, it may be appropriate for the {_Company} to represent that it does not use (or otherwise does not need) any employee- or consultant-created IP that it does not otherwise own. In such circumstances, consider adding the following representation: “Other than with respect to any Intellectual Property Rights owned by a Founder at the time of the {_Company}’s founding that have been assigned to the {_Company}, to the {_Company}’s knowledge, it is not and will not be necessary to use any Intellectual Property Rights of any of its current and former employees or consultants (or Persons it currently intends to hire) made prior to their engagement by {_Company}.”
32	Depending on the jurisdiction in which the {_Company} is based, it may be appropriate to include a representation relating to customary non-solicitation language residing in the {_Company}’s Confidential Information {_Agreement} forms. However, if the {_Company} is based in or has substantial operations in a state in which certain types of non-solicits (e.g., customer non-solicits or certain types of personnel-related non-solicits) may be unenforceable, such a representation would likely not be appropriate. In appropriate circumstances, consider adding the following representation: “If legally permissible, each current and former Key Employee has executed a non-solicitation agreement substantially in the form or forms made available to the {_Purchaser}s or their respective counsel.”
33	*Revised October 2024* While the consensus among the NVCA drafting group is that disclosure is better addressed as a diligence matter, some {_Purchaser}s will require a representation to ensure that all registered intellectual property has been disclosed/reviewed in due diligence – accordingly, prior versions of this model agreement contained the following, which could be added as Section {2.8.9.Xnum} if necessary: “Section {2.8.9.Xnum} of the Disclosure Schedule lists all {_Company}-Registered Intellectual Property, and all material domain names that are {_Company}-Controlled Intellectual Property.”
34	This representation regarding use of open source software is intended to elicit disclosure of publicly available, third-party source code that the {_Company} has incorporated, into its products under any license that imposes specified obligations upon the {_Company}, particularly so-called “copyleft” obligations. Much publicly available source code is distributed under permissive open source licenses that permit it to be freely used and redistributed without imposing copyleft obligations upon those that use it to develop their own software and listing all such code may be of little added value. A more expansive open source representation, which may be appropriate for distributed products to affirm the content of a list provided in diligence, is as follows: “The {_Company} has made available to the {_Purchaser}s and their counsel an accurate and complete list of all items of Open Source Software that it has embedded, linked, or distributed in connection with any {_Company} Code or any of its products or services or proprietary materials (whether generally available or in development), including the name of each such item and the license(s) applicable to each such item.” The primary benefits of requiring this expanded disclosure are: (1) the investors can confirm that the {_Company} is actually tracking its open source software usage; and (2) the investors can perform their own diligence on open source software usage instead of relying on the {_Company} to properly disclose against the narrower representation. Additional diligence may be appropriate, particularly given that acquirers often take a very risk-averse stance on open source license requirements and compliance.
35	Sections {2.8.Xnum},  {2.10.Xnum}, {2.11.Xnum} and {2.15.Xnum} require the {_Company} to disclose material contracts as well as other agreements or arrangements that might be important from a due diligence standpoint regardless of dollar amount (such as intellectual property licenses or a proposed acquisition of the {_Company}). The disclosure thresholds are negotiable. 
36	University licenses subject to Bayh-Dole will have march-in rights, so this exception reduces disclosure obligations for licenses already called out elsewhere.
37	In prior iterations of this model SPA, the following representation, while not standard, was included as optional: “The {_Company} has not engaged in the past [three months] in any discussion with any representative of any Person regarding (i) a sale or exclusive license of all or substantially all of the {_Company}’s assets, or (ii) any merger, consolidation or other business combination transaction of the {_Company} with or into another Person.” Because this rep is not standard, and rarely requested or given, it has been removed; the sentiment of the drafting committee is that this is best addressed as a diligence matter.
38	This representation requires disclosure of situations which could create a conflict of interest. This is an item of particular concern in the first round of venture capital financing, since loans among the {_Company} and its founders and their families (which may not be well documented) are especially common prior to the first infusion of outside capital.
39	Prior registration rights may conflict with those currently being negotiated among the investors and the {_Company}. Therefore, any such rights must be carefully reviewed, and any conflicts resolved. It is common to have any previous registration rights agreement amended to include the new investors or replaced by a new agreement, including the old and new investors and clarifying their rights relative to each other as well as the {_Company}. It is preferable to have all registration rights relating to the {_Company}’s securities set forth in one document. Having several different sets of rights outstanding can be a significant (and confusing) complication when the {_Company} goes public.
40	*New October 2024* For early-stage companies without financial statements, the drafter can remove the first two sentences and “Except as set forth in the Financial Statements” in the bracketed language below.
41 	*New October 2024* Use formation date (or other appropriate date) for companies that do not have financial statements.
42 	*New October 2024* Use if there are no financial statements.
43	*Revised October 2024* The purpose of this representation is to “bring down” the financial statements from the period covered thereby. While the itemization in this section serves as a useful due diligence checklist, this section can be replaced by a much shorter section reading simply, “[To the {_Company}’s knowledge], since [______,] there have been no events or circumstances of any kind that have had or could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.”
44 	*New October 2024* For companies without financial statements, use formation date (or other appropriate date).
45	See footnote 26.
46	The following representation can be added to focus attention on whether there are any diligence issues related to prior workplace misconduct: “or (e) informed, following an internal investigation: (i) by the {_Company} that such Key Employee or director has violated any {_Company} policy regarding appropriate workplace behavior or any {_Company} anti-harassment or anti-discrimination policy prohibiting discrimination and/or harassment at the {_Company}, or (ii) by any prior employer of the violation of any substantially similar policy.”
47	Consider PFIC/CFC representations as appropriate.
48	The investors may negotiate life insurance coverage in favor of the {_Company} for certain founders or other key employees. If such coverage is in effect prior to the closing, it may be appropriate to add to this representation a statement of the covered individuals and amount of coverage for each. 
49	*Revised October 2024* Prior versions of this model agreement included an optional representation (set forth below) related to 83(b) elections,  The consensus among the NVCA drafting group is that this is better addressed as a diligence matter and, so, the representation is no longer included above. Failure to file an 83(b) election is substantially the concern of the particular stockholder who failed to file; however, for employees who fail to file the {_Company} would have withholding obligations and for all failed filings the {_Company} would have reporting obligations.  If the parties feel a representation is appropriate, the following can be added as a representation: “83(b) Elections. To the {_Company}’s knowledge, all elections and notices under Section 83(b) of the Code have been timely filed by all individuals who have acquired unvested shares of the {_Company}’s Common Stock.”
50	This representation is appropriate if there are foreign investors (i.e., nonresident aliens) involved in the financing, since they are subject to the Foreign Investment Real Property Tax Act of 1980 (“FIRPTA”). Under FIRPTA, a transfer of an interest in a U.S. Real Property Holding Corporation (a “USRPHC”) by a foreign investor is subject to tax withholding, notwithstanding the general rule that sales of stock by foreigners are not subject to U.S. taxation. A corporation is USRPHC if more than 50% of its assets consist of U.S. real property. While very few, if any, venture capital investors are USRPHCs, it is customary to provide this representation in order to ensure that any foreign investors will not be subject to tax withholding. Regardless of FIRPTA, if a foreign person or entity is, directly or indirectly, acquiring a 10% or greater voting interest in the {_Company}, it must file Form BE-13 with the U.S. Department of Commerce unless an exemption applies.
51	Section 1202 of the Code provides for a 100% exclusion for U.S. federal income tax purposes (subject to certain limitations) from taxable income of gains recognized on the disposition of certain stock in qualifying corporations that has been held for at least five years. Although investors may ask for various representations about the QSBS eligibility of the {_Company}’s stock, companies may resist on the theory that the analysis regarding current compliance is complex, and that many elements of the test are outside the {_Company}’s control. In any event, compliance with numerous other requirements during the time the investor holds the stock is needed for the investor to qualify for the benefits of Section 1202. See also QSBS covenants in NVCA model IRA. 
52	The Small Business Concern representation is only necessary if one or more {_Purchaser}s is an SBIC.
53	Many early-stage companies may not have internal controls and policies in place and be unable to provide this representation. When this is the case, in lieu of a representation it might be appropriate for the {_Purchaser}s to request a post-closing covenant that the {_Company} will put such controls in place.
54	While these measures are likely required by the preceding representation, companies may not be aware that they have to take these measures in order to make the preceding rep, so it may be helpful to call out these measures specifically. 
55	This model agreement does not include a classification representation because companies cannot reasonably make the representation, and the representation regarding export licenses/approvals/filings should provide investors with sufficient protection.
56	For companies subject to these healthcare laws, it may be appropriate to specifically make representations in regards to healthcare specific laws, even though as a technical matter the general compliance with law representation likely covers these issues. 
57	In this representation, the {_Company} confirms that it is not a “TID U.S. business” within the meaning of that term pursuant to the regulations of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). Companies that are not TID U.S. businesses are (a) not subject to either of the two CFIUS mandatory filing regimes and (b) not subject to CFIUS’s extended jurisdiction over non-controlling transactions. This representation does not wholly eliminate the possibility of CFIUS intervention – CFIUS has the discretionary right to elect to intervene in any transaction that grants a foreign party a control stake in a U.S. business (e.g., an investment of 10% or more, or that otherwise grants substantive rights of control) – but it should provide investors with significant comfort. Some Companies will not be able to make all parts of this representation but will be able to make part (a), the “no critical technologies” representation, which would eliminate the need to make the most common form of mandatory CFIUS filing. The final line of the representation will provide investors additional comfort that reevaluation at the time of the next capital raise is not required. Either this representation or the {_Purchaser} representation in Section {3.9.Xnum}, below, is sufficient to show that no mandatory CFIUS filing applies; accordingly, if the {_Company} is able to make this representation, consider removing Section {3.9.Xnum}. 
58	For life science transactions, consider adding the representations and warranties in Sections 2.30 and 2.31. These can be customized to development stage of the {_Company}. 
59	*New Footnote* 21 CFR 312 applies to investigational new drug applications. 21 CFR 812 applies to investigational device exemption. These should be revised based on what is applicable to the {_Company}.
60	*New Footnote* This should be revised depending on what is applicable to the {_Company}.
61 	*New October 2024* In lieu of the more detailed representations at Sections 2.31 and 2.32, particularly for early stage companies, a less detailed representation such as the following could be included: “[FDA Regulation. The {_Company} is and has been in material compliance with all applicable laws administered or issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) or any other governmental entity or any institutional review board or comparable authority, including (without limitation) the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and all other applicable laws regarding developing, testing, manufacturing, complaint handling, adverse event [or medical device] reporting, marketing, distributing or promoting the products of the {_Company}.”
62	Include to the extent that these jurisdictions that are relevant.
63 	*New October 2024* The current Restricted Countries can be found at: https://ofac.treasury.gov/sanctions-programs-and-country-information.
64	Model language is to account for the fact that some listed parties may not be fully prohibited, but rather subject to more targeted restrictions.
65	This should be revised depending on what is applicable to the {_Company}.
66	In this representation, the {_Company} confirms that, to the extent is it regulated by the FCC or any similar state or international regulatory agency, it holds the appropriate authorization to conduct its business and that it is in material compliance with its obligations under the laws and regulations that govern the business. In addition to licenses issued by the FCC to operate telecommunications and media companies, the representation would cover the receipt of an authorization to import and sell in the United States any FCC-regulated electronic product. 
67	*Revised October 2024* The investors’ right of recovery for a breach of this rep may be broader than under SEC Rule 10b-5, because in order to prevail in a Rule 10b-5 securities fraud action, the purchaser must establish that the seller acted with scienter. That is, a purely innocent misrepresentation normally does not give rise to civil liability under 10b-5.
68	The main purpose of the {_Purchaser}s’ representations and warranties in Section {3.Xnum} are to ensure that the investors meet the criteria for private placement exceptions under applicable state and federal securities laws.
69	Occasionally, a venture capital fund will allow its employees and principals to co-invest through a special entity as a nominee. Assuming these employees and principals meet the accreditation or sophistication standards necessary for the private placement exemption being relied on, the language of this provision can be tailored to carve out that special entity.
70	Include the bracketed language if the private placement exemption is based on the safe harbor in Rule 155(c) under the Securities Act for private offerings following an abandoned public offering.
71	*Revised October 2024* If the {_Company} cannot make the representation in Section {2.29.Xnum}, the {_Company} may desire to make this representation so each the {_Purchaser} confirms that it (x) is not a “foreign person” within the meaning of that term pursuant to the regulations of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), and (y) does not permit a foreign person to obtain CFIUS triggering rights by virtue of its investment. If the {_Company} cannot make the representation in Section {2.29.Xnum}, and one or more {_Purchaser}s is a “foreign person” for CFIUS purposes and permits a foreign person to obtain CFIUS triggering rights by virtue of its investment, the transaction may be subject to CFIUS review in either its mandatory or elective forms. Either this representation or the {_Company} representation in Section {2.29.Xnum}, above, is sufficient to show that no mandatory CFIUS filing applies.
72 	*New October 2024* While it is the consensus of the NVCA drafting group that the {_Company} approach “who” are its “beneficial owners” for purposes of the CTA as a diligence matter in reverse, if the {_Company} feels it must have a representation on point, the following can be added: “Except as otherwise disclosed to the {_Company} on or prior to the date the applicable {_Purchaser} became party to this {_Agreement}, if {_Purchaser} is not a natural person, (a) and if {_Purchaser}, together with any Affiliate, will own 25% or more of the {_Company} upon the applicable Closing, no natural person will (i) own (directly or indirectly) 25% or more of the ownership interests of the {_Company} or (ii) control (directly or indirectly) the {_Purchaser}’s ownership interest in the {_Company}; and (b) and if {_Purchaser} will, directly or indirectly, have “substantial control” (as defined in the CTA) over the {_Company} (as reasonably determined in good faith by such {_Purchaser}), no natural person affiliated with such {_Purchaser} will, directly or indirectly, exercise substantial control over the {_Company}.”  Be sure the defined term CTA is included in the definitions section, above.
73	*Revised October 2024* Section {4.Xnum} contains the conditions which the {_Company} must satisfy (or which must be waived) prior to closing in order to trigger the investors’ obligation to purchase the shares; Section {5.Xnum} contains the conditions the investors must satisfy to trigger the {_Company}’s obligation to sell the shares. With respect to each side, the essential requirements are (A) that all of the representations and warranties each makes in the {_Agreement} are still true at the closing, and (B) that the other parties have entered into the other Transaction {_Agreement}s. If the {_Agreement} contemplates multiple closings (e.g., milestone closings), attention should be given to determining what conditions must be satisfied in order to trigger the investors’ obligations to purchase shares at subsequent closings, it may be appropriate to include a separate, more limited set of closing conditions for those subsequent closings. If the transaction is structured as a simultaneous signing and closing, the closing conditions serve as a convenient closing checklist, but are significantly diminished in importance. 
74	*Revised October 2024* Opinions can be expensive and time consuming; particularly for early-stage deals, and as a result the parties might agree to forego a legal opinion as a condition precedent.
75	*Revised October 2024* If there are no changes to the Board composition as part of the transaction, it may not be necessary to list this closing condition.
76 	*Revised October 2024* An investor interested in the formation of specific committees should consider making their creation a condition to closing. Such committees are typically more appropriate for later stage companies and/or larger boards.  If Investors desire even more control over committee composition, consider adding a protective provision in the Certificate of Incorporation.
77	*Revised October 2024* Sometimes a minimum aggregate investment amount is required for any {_Purchaser} to close; it is typically simplest to express that as a number of {_Shares} must be sold at the {_Initial_Closing} (though, in a simultaneous sign and close this is generally of limited utility).
78	See explanatory commentary in introduction to model Management Rights Letter.
79	*Revised October 2024* Sometimes, although rarely, a limited survival period is negotiated.
80	Delaware law has historically been the richest source for corporation law precedent. 
81	This model agreement provides that any cc to counsel be set forth on the Schedule of {_Purchaser}s/Exhibit A – this way in future rounds, the cc is not simply replaced with the new round’s lead investor’s counsel.
82	*Revised October 2024* Typically, only the fees of the lead {_Purchaser} are reimbursed by the {_Company}. If other {_Purchaser}s have separate counsel and the {_Company} has agreed to reimburse the fees, this provision will need to be tailored accordingly.
83	This clause is only necessary where the transaction is structured to be signed in advance of, and not simultaneously with, the {_Initial_Closing}. As discussed above, most transactions are simultaneously signed and closed.
84	Section 6.14 is to be used for transactions governed by California law that are not relying on NSMIA for a state securities law exemption. Please note the title of the California Commissioner of Corporations changed to the Commissioner of Financial Protection and Innovation in 2020.
85	Some parties prefer to use the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) instead of JAMS.
86	Binding arbitration may be less expensive and more efficient than litigating disputes in court. Additionally, it may be more confidential. However, some investors dislike that the result cannot be appealed, and the arbitrator(s) is not bound to follow case law and precedent.
87 	If Alternative 1 (arbitration) is being used for dispute resolution, the jury trial waiver language should always be included. If Alternative 2 (court) is being used for dispute resolution, then this provision is optional.
88	If the parties select California state court as the forum for any dispute resolution, a jury trial waiver will likely be unenforceable. Instead, the parties can choose to submit to trial by judicial referee, a private person (typically a retired judge) the parties select. All California rules of court, procedure and evidence govern judicial reference proceedings and, unlike with arbitration, the decision may be appealed. Accordingly, if the parties select California state court, and would like to backstop the jury waiver, we recommend including the following provision as a next paragraph:  If the waiver of jury trial set forth in this section is not enforceable, then any claim or cause of action based upon or arising out of this {_Agreement}, the other Transaction {_Agreement}s, the securities or the subject matter hereof or thereof shall be settled by judicial reference pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 638 et seq. before a referee sitting without a jury, such referee to be mutually acceptable to the parties. Each party will bear an equal share of the cost for the judicial referee. This paragraph shall not restrict a party from exercising remedies under the Uniform Commercial Code or from exercising prejudgment remedies under applicable law.
89	This model agreement provides a simplified/condensed form of a signature page, which should be customized as appropriate.
90	The notice provision provides that notice addresses be either on the signature pages or in the Schedule of {_Purchaser}s – accordingly, the {_Company}’s notice address/email address need to be on the signature page (as the {_Company} isn’t listed on the Schedule of {_Purchaser}s) and, for simplicity, the {_Purchaser}’s addresses should only be included in the Schedule of {_Purchaser}s.
91	Carefully customize the table here so the column headings align with the language used in Section {1.Xnum} and provide clarity for each series, each purchase price, etc. Additionally, note that aggregate purchase prices need to be rounded up to the nearest penny to ensure fully paid shares.
92	Include the legal name of the {_Purchaser}, its notice address, and if applicable, any cc (stating that the cc shall not itself constitute notice).
93 	*New October 2024* In practice, this language should be moved from here to the draft of the Disclosure Schedule.
