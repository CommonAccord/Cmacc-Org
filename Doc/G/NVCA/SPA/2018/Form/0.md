SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT
 
Preliminary Note
The Stock Purchase Agreement sets forth the basic terms of the purchase and sale of the preferred stock to the investors (such as the purchase price, closing date, conditions to closing) and identifies the other financing documents. Generally this agreement does not set forth either (1) the characteristics of the stock being sold (which are defined in the Certificate of Incorporation) or (2) the relationship among the parties after the closing, such as registration rights, rights of first refusal and co-sale, voting arrangements (these matters often implicate other persons than just the Company and the investors in this round of financing, and are usually embodied in separate agreements to which those others persons are parties, or in some cases by the Certificate of Incorporation). The main items of negotiation in the Stock Purchase Agreement are therefore the price and number of shares being sold, and the representations and warranties that the Company, and sometimes the Founders as well, must make to the investors.

2.8.Ti=	Intellectual Property.  [The Company owns or possesses or [believes it] can acquire on commercially reasonable terms sufficient legal rights to all Company Intellectual Property without any known conflict with, or infringement of, the rights of others, including prior employees or consultants, [or academic or medical institutions] with which any of them may be affiliated now or may have been affiliated in the past.] [To the Company’s knowledge,] no product or service marketed or sold (or proposed to be marketed or sold) by the Company violates or will violate any license or infringes or will infringe any intellectual property rights of any other party. Other than with respect to commercially available software products under standard end-user object code license agreements, there are no outstanding options, licenses, agreements, claims, encumbrances or shared ownership interests of any kind relating to the Company Intellectual Property, nor is the Company bound by or a party to any options, licenses or agreements of any kind with respect to the patents, trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights, trade secrets, licenses, information, proprietary rights and processes of any other Person. The Company has not received any communications alleging that the Company has violated, or by conducting its business, would violate any of the patents, trademarks, service marks, tradenames, copyrights, trade secrets, mask works or other proprietary rights or processes of any other Person. The Company has obtained and possesses valid licenses to use all of the software programs present on the computers and other software-enabled electronic devices that it owns or leases or that it has otherwise provided to its employees for their use in connection with the Company’s business. [To the Company’s knowledge,] it will not be necessary to use any inventions of any of its employees or consultants (or Persons it currently intends to hire) made prior to their employment by the Company, including prior employees or consultants, [or academic or medical institutions] with which any of them may be affiliated now or may have been affiliated in the past. Each employee and consultant has assigned to the Company all intellectual property rights he or she owns that are related to the Company’s business as now conducted and as presently proposed to be conducted and all intellectual property rights that he, she or it solely or jointly conceived, reduced to practice, developed or made during the period of his, her or its employment or consulting relationship with the Company that (a) relate, at the time of conception, reduction to practice, development, or making of such intellectual property right, to the Company’s business as then conducted or as then proposed to be conducted, (b) were developed on any amount of the Company’s time or with the use of any of the Company’s equipment, supplies, facilities or information or (c) resulted from the performance of services for the Company.

No government funding, facilities of a university, college, other educational institution or research center, or funding from third parties was used in the development of any Company Intellectual Property. No Person who was involved in, or who contributed to, the creation or development of any Company Intellectual Property, has performed services for the government, university, college, or other educational institution or research center in a manner that would affect Company’s rights in the Company Intellectual Property.

The execution, delivery and performance of the Transaction Agreements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements will not result in any such violation or be in conflict with or constitute, with or without the passage of time and giving of notice, either (i) a default under any such provision, instrument, judgment, order, writ, decree, contract or agreement; or (ii) an event which results in the creation of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any assets of the Company or the suspension, revocation, forfeiture, or nonrenewal of any material permit or license applicable to the Company.
