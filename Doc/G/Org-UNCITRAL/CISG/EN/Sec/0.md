Part II. Formation of the contract

14.Ti=Article 14

14.1.sec=A proposal for concluding a contract addressed to one or more specific persons constitutes an offer if it is sufficiently definite and indicates the intention of the offeror to be bound in case of acceptance. A proposal is sufficiently definite if it indicates the goods and expressly or implicitly fixes or makes provision for determining the quantity and the price.

14.2.sec=A proposal other than one addressed to one or more specific ­persons is to be considered merely as an invitation to make offers, unless the contrary is clearly indicated by the person making the proposal.

14.=[G/Z/ol/s2]

15.Ti=Article 15

15.1.sec=An offer becomes effective when it reaches the offeree.

15.2.sec=An offer, even if it is irrevocable, may be withdrawn if the ­withdrawal reaches the offeree before or at the same time as the offer.

15.=[G/Z/ol/s2]

16.2.=[G/Z/ol-a/s2]

16.=[G/Z/ol/s2]

17.Ti=Article 17

17.sec=An offer, even if it is irrevocable, is terminated when a rejection reaches the offeror.

18.Ti=Article 18

18.1.sec=A statement made by or other conduct of the offeree indicating ­assent to an offer is an acceptance. Silence or inactivity does not in itself amount to acceptance.

18.2.sec=An acceptance of an offer becomes effective at the moment the indication of assent reaches the offeror. An acceptance is not effective if the indication of assent does not reach the offeror within the time he has fixed or, if no time is fixed, within a reasonable time, due account being taken of the circumstances of the transaction, including the rapidity of the means of communication employed by the offeror. An oral offer must be accepted immediately unless the circumstances indicate otherwise.

18.3.sec=However, if, by virtue of the offer or as a result of practices which the parties have established between themselves or of usage, the offeree may indicate assent by performing an act, such as one relating to the dispatch of the goods or payment of the price, without notice to the offeror, the ­acceptance is effective at the moment the act is performed, provided that the act is ­performed within the period of time laid down in the preceding paragraph.

18.=[G/Z/ol/s3]

19.Ti=Article 19

19.1.sec=A reply to an offer which purports to be an acceptance but contains additions, limitations or other modifications is a rejection of the offer and constitutes a counter-offer.

19.2.sec=However, a reply to an offer which purports to be an acceptance but contains additional or different terms which do not materially alter the terms of the offer constitutes an acceptance, unless the offeror, without undue delay, objects orally to the discrepancy or dispatches a notice to that effect. If he does not so object, the terms of the contract are the terms of the offer with the modifications contained in the acceptance.

19.3.sec=Additional or different terms relating, among other things, to the price, payment, quality and quantity of the goods, place and time of delivery, extent of one party’s liability to the other or the settlement of disputes are considered to alter the terms of the offer materially.

19.=[G/Z/ol/s3]

20.Ti=Article 20

20.1.sec=A period of time for acceptance fixed by the offeror in a telegram or a letter begins to run from the moment the telegram is handed in for ­dispatch or from the date shown on the letter or, if no such date is shown, from the date shown on the envelope. A period of time for acceptance fixed by the offeror by telephone, telex or other means of instantaneous ­communication, begins to run from the moment that the offer reaches the offeree.

20.2.sec=Official holidays or non-business days occurring during the period for acceptance are included in calculating the period. However, if a notice of acceptance cannot be delivered at the address of the offeror on the last day of the period because that day falls on an official holiday or a ­non-business day at the place of business of the offeror, the period is ­extended until the first business day which follows.

20.=[G/Z/ol/s2]

21.Ti=Article 21

21.1.sec=A late acceptance is nevertheless effective as an acceptance if without delay the offeror orally so informs the offeree or dispatches a notice to that effect.

21.2.sec=If a letter or other writing containing a late acceptance shows that it has been sent in such circumstances that if its transmission had been normal it would have reached the offeror in due time, the late acceptance is effective as an acceptance unless, without delay, the offeror orally informs the offeree that he considers his offer as having lapsed or dispatches a notice to that effect.

21.=[G/Z/ol/s2]

22.Ti=Article 22

22.sec=An acceptance may be withdrawn if the withdrawal reaches the ­offeror before or at the same time as the acceptance would have become effective.

23.Ti=Article 23

23.sec=A contract is concluded at the moment when an acceptance of an offer becomes effective in accordance with the provisions of this Convention.

24.Ti=Article 24

24.sec=For the purposes of this Part of the Convention, an offer, declaration of acceptance or any other indication of intention “reaches” the addressee when it is made orally to him or delivered by any other means to him personally, to his place of business or mailing address or, if he does not have a place of business or mailing address, to his habitual residence.

Part III. Sale of goods

Chapter I. General provisions

25.Ti=Article 25

25.sec=A breach of contract committed by one of the parties is fundamental if it results in such detriment to the other party as substantially to deprive him of what he is entitled to expect under the contract, unless the party in breach did not foresee and a reasonable person of the same kind in the same circumstances would not have foreseen such a result.

26.Ti=Article 26

26.sec=A declaration of avoidance of the contract is effective only if made by notice to the other party.

27.Ti=Article 27

27.sec=Unless otherwise expressly provided in this Part of the Convention, if any notice, request or other communication is given or made by a party in accordance with this Part and by means appropriate in the circumstances, a delay or error in the transmission of the communication or its failure to arrive does not deprive that party of the right to rely on the communication.

28.Ti=Article 28

28.sec=If, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, one party is entitled to require performance of any obligation by the other party, a court is not bound to enter a judgement for specific performance unless the court would do so under its own law in respect of similar contracts of sale not governed by this Convention.

29.Ti=Article 29

29.1.sec=A contract may be modified or terminated by the mere agreement of the parties.

29.2.sec=A contract in writing which contains a provision requiring any modification or termination by agreement to be in writing may not be otherwise modified or terminated by agreement. However, a party may be precluded by his conduct from asserting such a provision to the extent that the other party has relied on that conduct.

67.=[G/Z/ol/s2]

68.sec=The risk in respect of goods sold in transit passes to the buyer from the time of the conclusion of the contract. However, if the circumstances so indicate, the risk is assumed by the buyer from the time the goods were handed over to the carrier who issued the documents embodying the contract of carriage.

73.3.sec=A buyer who declares the contract avoided in respect of any ­delivery may, at the same time, declare it avoided in respect of deliveries already made or of future deliveries if, by reason of their interdependence, those deliveries could not be used for the purpose contemplated by the ­parties at the time of the conclusion of the contract.

If, however, the party claiming ­damages has avoided the contract after taking over the goods, the current price at the time of such taking over shall be applied instead of the current price at the time of avoidance.

76.2.sec=For the purposes of the preceding paragraph, the current price is the price prevailing at the place where delivery of the goods should have been made or, if there is no current price at that place, the price at such other place as serves as a reasonable substitute, making due allowance for differences in the cost of transporting the goods.

76.=[G/Z/ol/s2]

77.Ti=Article 77

77.sec=A party who relies on a breach of contract must take such measures as are reasonable in the circumstances to mitigate the loss, including loss of profit, resulting from the breach.

79.2.1.sec=he is exempt under the preceding paragraph; and

79.2.2.sec=the person whom he has so engaged would be so exempt if the provisions of that paragraph were applied to him.

79.3.sec=The exemption provided by this article has effect for the period during which the impediment exists.
