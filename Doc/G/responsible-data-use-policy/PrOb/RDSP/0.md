Introduction.Ti=Introduction

Principle.Ti=PRINCIPLES

Principle.0.sec={Principles.Three/Four} principles guide the responsible use of data and models by {Organization.Name.Full} (“{Def.Organization.Target}”).  When the policy or related procedures are unclear, these Principles can be used to guide decisions.

Principle.1.sec=Principle 1: The {_Organization} should continuously identify and understand risks arising from its data science activities, regardless of whether the harm might be external or internal.

Principle.2.sec=Principle 2: The {_Organization} should use data science to contribute positively to the people, processes, and performance of the {_Organization}.

Principle.3.sec=Principle 3: Whenever reasonably possible, the {_Organization} should manage risks arising from its data science activities, such as through risk avoidance, reduction, or offset, regardless of whether the harm might be external or internal.

Note=Optional

Principle.4.sec=Principle 4: Whenever reasonably possible, the {_Organization} should use data science to contribute positively to people, societies, and environments more broadly.

Principle.=[G/Z/ol/s4]

Purpose.Ti=PURPOSE

Purpose.sec=The {_Organization} desires that its data science activities be conducted in a responsible manner that aligns with the Principles above.  The objective of this {_Policy} is to ensure that the {_Organization} works to achieve these Principles from a technical, legal, and ethical perspective by establishing the standards, restrictions, and procedures that govern data science activities within the {_Organization}.

Purpose.=[G/Z/Base]

Scope.Ti=SCOPE

Scope.0.sec=This {_Policy} applies to:

Scope.1.sec=All data science activities, including those commonly described as statistical analysis, business intelligence, analytics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, or any other similar activities (collectively, “{Def.Data_Science.Target}”)

Scope.2.sec=All {employees/employees_and_contractors} that manage or perform {_Data_Science} (“{Def.Personnel.Target}”)

Scope.3.sec=All data that is used by {_Organization} in the context of {_Data_Science} (“{Def.Covered_Data.Target}”) 

Scope.4.sec=All models that are used by {_Organization} in the context of {_Data_Science} (“{Def.Covered_Models.Target}”), whether used on a continual basis or not

Scope.=[G/Z/ol/s4]

Procedure.Ti=PROCEDURES

Procedure.0.sec={PolicyOwner.Name.Full} is responsible for establishing a parent Procedure and one or more Sub-Procedures to govern the process of executing on this {_Policy}.  Two types of Sub-Procedures are supported under this {_Policy}.

Procedure.1.Ti=Prescriptive Sub-Procedure

Procedure.1.0.sec=A Prescriptive Procedure defines the following:

Procedure.1.1.sec=Clear criteria regarding the transparency, use, provenance, and general nature of {_Covered_Data} and {_Covered_Models} 

Procedure.1.2.sec=Minimum standard of transformation for attributes or {_Data_Subjects}

Procedure.1.3.sec=Minimum acceptance criteria for release, such as differential privacy metrics

Procedure.1.00.sec=When these standards and restrictions can be met, projects can generally proceed with little to no additional review.

Procedure.1.=[G/Z/ol/s3]

Procedure.2.Ti=Adjudicative Sub-Procedure

Procedure.2.0.sec=An Adjudicative Procedure utilizes the following:

ReadersNote="Submitter" is defined but not used in this Policy.

Procedure.2.1.sec=A Data Science Proposal Form, to be completed by the requesting party (“{Def.Submitter.Target}”)

Procedure.2.2.sec=A Data Science Adjudicator (“{Def.Adjudicator.Target}”) responsible for evaluating such Data Science Proposals

Procedure.2.00.1.sec=Submitters complete Data Science Proposal Forms, which are then sent to the responsible {_Adjudicator} for review.  The {_Adjudicator}, which may be an individual or a larger group such as a committee or board, may reject the proposal, request further information or modification, or approve the proposal upon review.

Procedure.2.00.2.sec={PolicyOwner.Name.Full} is responsible for the establishment of one or more adjudicators, who must possess relevant experience and qualifications to support the assessment of technical, legal, and ethical considerations. {PolicyOwner.Name.Full} may create a single {_Adjudicator} to review all Proposals or may create multiple {_Adjudicators} to address one-time or recurring use cases such as industry, regulation, or geography.
