<h3 align="center">Responsible Data Science Policy</h3>

  <p align="center">
    This project is an open source compliance framework containing policies, procedures, supporting artifacts, and documentation.  
    <br />
    <br />
    Its goal is to enable organizations to more effectively implement and communicate their commitments and controls related to responsible data use and data science.

## WHY?
Data science is hard. Figuring out how to integrate data science into your risk management and compliance frameworks is even harder. Employees, customers, investors, and regulators, however, don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs not easy; they just want to know that you have a responsible plan to make it happen. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre open-sourcing a Responsible Data Science Policy framework to help organizations get started on this journey.

This framework has been developed to respond to a perceived market need for better internal risk management and external trust-building, especially as data science topics emerge in conversations with customers, regulators, investors, or the broader public. The framework is designed around principles, listed in the policy, that have been chosen to produce technical, legal, and ethical results that both internal and external stakeholders can agree to. As such, this framework is not the most legally conservative or financially aggressive; it makes a number of assumptions and compromises that organizations should carefully consider prior to adoption.

Furthermore, this framework is not intended to provide sufficient controls to meet any specific law or regulation. While many of the elements of this policy are necessary for compliance with laws such as GDPR or CCPA or standards such as SOC2/TSC, this policy alone is not sufficient for such compliance. Organizations should carefully consider how this policy fits into their overall legal and contractual requirements prior to adoption, ensuring that any relevant sections, e.g., related to consent or notice, are conformant.

## HOW DOES IT WORK?
This policy framework is designed to be flexible and adaptable. That is, it can both cover a wide range of organizations and it can change with those organizations over time. In order to accomplish this, the policy is designed around a parent procedure that routes specific use cases or projects through two types of sub-procedures. Prescriptive sub-procedures give data science teams guardrails and a path for low-friction compliance. Adjudicative sub-procedures centralize decision-making with an individual or group like a risk committee. Organizations can mix and match prescriptive and adjudicative sub-procedures to meet their needs.

The diagram below helps visualize the structure of the framework.
