2.2.Ti=Service Levels

2.2.sec={_Provider} shall provide the remedies listed in the {_SLA} for any failure of the {_SaaS} listed in the {_SLA}. Such remedies are {_Customer}’s sole remedy for any failure of the {_SaaS}, and {_Customer} recognizes and agrees that if the {_SLA} does not list a remedy for a given failure, it has no remedy; provided this sentence does not restrict any {_Customer} right to terminate this {_Agreement} for breach where applicable. Credits issued pursuant to the {_SLA} apply to outstanding or future invoices only and are forfeit upon termination of this {_Agreement}. {_Provider} is not required to issue refunds or to make payments against such credits under any circumstances, including without limitation after termination of this {_Agreement}.

3.Ti=SAAS FEES

3.1.sec={_Customer} shall pay {_Provider} the fee set forth in each {_Order} for each {_Term}. {_Provider} will not be required to refund fees under any circumstances. {_Provider}’s invoices are due within 30 days of issuance.

However, the preceding sentence does not apply to the extent that {_Customer} is tax exempt, provided it gives {_Provider} a valid tax exemption certificate within 30 days of the {_Effective_Date}. {_Provider}’s failure to include any applicable tax in an invoice will not waive or dismiss its rights or obligations pursuant to this Section {3.2.Xnum}. If applicable law requires withholding or deduction of {_Sales_Taxes} or any other tax or duty, {_Customer} shall separately pay {_Provider} the withheld or deducted amount, over and above fees due. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section {3.2.Xnum} does not govern taxes based on {_Provider}’s net income.

If {_Provider} receives a “right to know,” deletion, “right to be forgotten,” or similar request related to {_Customer_Data}, {_Provider} may respond in accordance with applicable law.

4.7.sec=Notwithstanding the provisions above of this Article {4.Xnum}, {_Provider} may disclose {_Customer_Data} as required by applicable law or by proper legal or governmental authority. {_Provider} shall give {_Customer} prompt notice of any such legal or governmental demand and reasonably cooperate with {_Customer} in any effort to seek a protective order or otherwise to contest such required disclosure, at {_Customer}’s expense.

4.8.Ti=Risk of Exposure

4.8.sec={_Customer} recognizes and agrees that hosting data online involves risks of unauthorized disclosure or exposure and that, in accessing and using the {_SaaS}, {_Customer} assumes such risks. {_Provider} offers no representation, warranty, or guarantee that {_Customer_Data} will not be exposed or disclosed through errors or the actions of third parties.

(“{DefT.Excluded_Data}” means {ExcludedData.Def.cl}. “{DefT.Excluded_Data_Laws}” means any law or regulation governing {_Excluded_Data}, including without limitation any law or regulation protecting privacy or security rights of {_Excluded_Data} subjects, as well as the following statutes and regulations: {ExcludedData.Laws.cl}.)

Neither this {_Agreement} nor the {_AUP} requires that {_Provider} take any action against {_Customer} or any {_User} or other third party for violating the {_AUP}, this Section {5.1.Xnum}, or this {_Agreement}, but {_Provider} is free to take any such action it sees fit.

7.1.Ti=Nondisclosure

NoteLawyer=Should this be the same as a "Purpose" definition for use by the {_Customer}?  (Note that the only definition of "Purpose" so far is use by {_Customer}'s Clients.)

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, {_Customer} shall protect {_Confidential_Information} with the same degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information of similar nature and importance, but with no less than reasonable care. {_Customer} shall promptly notify {_Provider} of any misuse or misappropriation of {_Confidential_Information} that comes to {_Customer}’s attention. Notwithstanding the foregoing, {_Customer} may disclose {_Confidential_Information} as required by applicable law or by proper legal or governmental authority. {_Customer} shall give {_Provider} prompt notice of any such legal or governmental demand and reasonably cooperate with {_Provider} in any effort to seek a protective order or otherwise to contest such required disclosure, at {_Provider}’s expense.

7.3.sec={_Customer} agrees that: (a) no adequate remedy exists at law if it breaches any of its obligations in this Article {7.Xnum}; (b) it would be difficult to determine the damages resulting from its breach of this Article {7.Xnum}, and such breach would cause irreparable harm to {_Provider}; and (iii) a grant of injunctive relief provides the best remedy for any such breach, without any requirement that {_Provider} prove actual damage or post a bond or other security. {_Customer} waives any opposition to such injunctive relief or any right to such proof, bond, or other security. (This Section {7.3.Xnum} does not limit either party’s right to injunctive relief for breaches not listed.)

7.4.Ti=Retention of Rights

7.4.sec=This {_Agreement} does not transfer ownership of {_Confidential_Information} or grant a license thereto. {_Provider} will retain all right, title, and interest in and to all {_Confidential_Information}.

7.5.2.sec=An individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual- (A) files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and (B) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.

8.2.1.Ti=Re {_Customer} Itself

8.2.1.sec={_Customer} represents and warrants that: (i) it has the full right and authority to enter into, execute, and perform its obligations under this {_Agreement} and that no pending or threatened claim or litigation known to it would have a material adverse impact on its ability to perform as required by this {_Agreement}; (ii) it has accurately identified itself and it has not provided any inaccurate information about itself to or through the {_SaaS}; and (iii) it is a corporation, the sole proprietorship of an individual 18 years or older, or another entity authorized to do business pursuant to applicable law.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (a) {_Provider} has no obligation to indemnify or defend {_Customer} or users against claims related to infringement of intellectual property; (b) {_Provider} does not represent or warrant that the {_SaaS} will perform without interruption or error; and (c) {_Provider} does not represent or warrant that the {_SaaS} is secure from hacking or other unauthorized intrusion or that {_Customer_Data} will remain private or secure.</span>

(“{DefT.Provider_Associates}” are {_Provider}’s officers, directors, shareholders, parents, subsidiaries, agents, successors, and assigns. A “{DefT.Data_Incident}” is any (1) unauthorized disclosure of, access to, or use of {_Customer_Data}, including without limitation {_Excluded_Data}, or (2) violation of {_Privacy/Security_Law} through {_Customer}’s account. {_Data_Incidents} include, without limitation, such events caused by {_Customer}, by {_Provider}, by {_Customer}’s {_Customers} or other users, by hackers, and by any other third party.)
