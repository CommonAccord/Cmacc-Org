Ti=Confidential Information

Def.sec=“{DefT.Confidential_Information}” refers to the following items {_Provider} discloses to {_Customer}: (a) any document {_Provider} marks “Confidential”; (b) any information {_Provider} orally designates as “Confidential” at the time of disclosure, provided {_Provider} confirms such designation in writing within {ConfInfo.Provider.Confirmation.Days.cl}; (c) the {_Documentation} and {ConfInfo.Provider.Include.cl}, whether or not marked or designated confidential; and (d) any other nonpublic, sensitive information {_Customer} should reasonably consider a trade secret or otherwise confidential. Notwithstanding the foregoing, {_Confidential_Information} does not include information that: (i) is in {_Customer}’s possession at the time of disclosure; (ii) is independently developed by {_Customer} without use of or reference to {_Confidential_Information}; (iii) becomes known publicly, before or after disclosure, other than as a result of {_Customer}’s improper action or inaction; or (iv) is approved for release in writing by {_Provider}.

Engage.Ti=Nondisclosure

NoteLawyer=Should this be the same as a "Purpose" definition for use by the {_Customer}?  (Note that the only definition of "Purpose" so far is use by {_Customer}'s Clients.) 

Engage.sec={_Customer} shall not use {_Confidential_Information} for any purpose other than {SaaS.Purpose.cl} (the “{DefT.Purpose}”). {_Customer}: (a) shall not disclose {_Confidential_Information} to any employee or contractor of {_Customer} unless such person needs access in order to facilitate the {_Purpose} and executes a nondisclosure agreement with {_Customer} with terms no less restrictive than those of this Article {IP.Feedback.Xnum}; and (b) shall not disclose {_Confidential_Information} to any other third party without {_Provider}’s prior written consent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, {_Customer} shall protect {_Confidential_Information} with the same degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information of similar nature and importance, but with no less than reasonable care. {_Customer} shall promptly notify {_Provider} of any misuse or misappropriation of {_Confidential_Information} that comes to {_Customer}’s attention. Notwithstanding the foregoing, {_Customer} may disclose {_Confidential_Information} as required by applicable law or by proper legal or governmental authority. {_Customer} shall give {_Provider} prompt notice of any such legal or governmental demand and reasonably cooperate with {_Provider} in any effort to seek a protective order or otherwise to contest such required disclosure, at {_Provider}’s expense.

End.Ti=Termination & Return

End.sec=With respect to each item of {_Confidential_Information}, the obligations of Section {Engage.Xnum} above ({Engage.Ti}) will terminate {Engage.Life.FromDisclosure.Period} after the date of disclosure; provided that such obligations related to {_Confidential_Information} constituting {_Provider}’s trade secrets shall continue so long as such information remains subject to trade secret protection pursuant to applicable law. Upon termination of this {_Agreement}, {_Customer} shall return all copies of {_Confidential_Information} to {_Provider} or certify, in writing, the destruction thereof.

End.=[G/Z/Base]

Injunction.Ti=Injunction

Injunction.sec={_Customer} agrees that: (a) no adequate remedy exists at law if it breaches any of its obligations in this Article {Xnum}; (b) it would be difficult to determine the damages resulting from its breach of this Article {Xnum}, and such breach would cause irreparable harm to {_Provider}; and (iii) a grant of injunctive relief provides the best remedy for any such breach, without any requirement that {_Provider} prove actual damage or post a bond or other security. {_Customer} waives any opposition to such injunctive relief or any right to such proof, bond, or other security. (This Section {Injunction.Xnum} does not limit either party’s right to injunctive relief for breaches not listed.)

Ownership.Ti=Retention of Rights

Ownership.sec=This {_Agreement} does not transfer ownership of {_Confidential_Information} or grant a license thereto. {_Provider} will retain all right, title, and interest in and to all {_Confidential_Information}.
