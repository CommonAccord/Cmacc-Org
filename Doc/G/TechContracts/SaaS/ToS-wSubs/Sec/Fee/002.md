Ti=SaaS Fees

Pay.Ti=Fees

Pay.sec={_Customer} shall pay {_Provider} the fee set forth in each {_Order} for each {_Term}. {_Provider} will not be required to refund fees under any circumstances. {_Provider}’s invoices are due within 30 days of issuance. For late payment, {_Customer} shall pay interest charges from the time the payment was due at the rate that is the lower of {Late.InterestChargePerMonth.%} per month or the highest rate permissible under applicable law.

Tax.Ti=Taxes

Tax.sec=Amounts due under this {_Agreement} are payable to {_Provider} without deduction for any tax, tariff, duty, or assessment imposed by any government authority (national, state, provincial, or local), including without limitation any sales, use, excise, ad valorem, property, withholding, or value-added tax, whether or not withheld at the source (collectively, “{DefT.Sales_Tax}”). Except as forbidden by applicable law, {_Provider} may require that {_Customer} submit applicable {_Sales_Taxes} to {_Provider}. However, the preceding sentence does not apply to the extent that {_Customer} is tax exempt, provided it gives {_Provider} a valid tax exemption certificate within 30 days of the {_Effective_Date}. {_Provider}’s failure to include any applicable tax in an invoice will not waive or dismiss its rights or obligations pursuant to this Section {Tax.Xnum}. If applicable law requires withholding or deduction of {_Sales_Taxes} or any other tax or duty, {_Customer} shall separately pay {_Provider} the withheld or deducted amount, over and above fees due. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section {Tax.Xnum} does not govern taxes based on {_Provider}’s net income.
