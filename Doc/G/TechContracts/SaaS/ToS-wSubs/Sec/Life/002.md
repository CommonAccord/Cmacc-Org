Ti=Term & Termination

Term.Ti=Term

Term.sec=The term of this {_Agreement} (the “{DefT.Term}”) shall commence on the {_Effective_Date} and continue for the period set forth in the {_Order} or, if none, for {Contract.Life.Period}. Thereafter, the {_Term} will renew for successive {Contract.Life.Renewal.Period} periods, unless either party refuses such renewal by written notice 30 or more days before the renewal date.

TerminateForCause.Ti=Termination for Cause

TerminateForCause.sec=Either party may terminate this {_Agreement} for the other’s material breach by written notice specifying in detail the nature of the breach, effective in 30 days unless the other party first cures such breach, or effective immediately if the breach is not subject to cure. Without limiting {_Provider}’s other rights and remedies, {_Provider} may suspend or terminate a {_Customer’s_Client}’s or other {_User}’s access to the {_SaaS} at any time, without advanced notice, if {_Provider} reasonably concludes such {_Customer’s_Client} or other {_User} has conducted itself in a way that is not consistent with the requirements of the {_AUP} or the other requirements of this {_Agreement} or in a way that subjects {_Provider} to potential liability.

NoteLawyer=The reference to 8.2 should be to 8.3 - it is the Limitations on warranties that should survive.  HAVE CHANGED THIS.

EffectOfTermination.Ti=Effects of Termination

EffectOfTermination.sec=Upon termination of this {_Agreement}, {_Customer} shall cease all use of the {_SaaS} and delete, destroy, or return all copies of the {_Documentation} in its possession or control. The following provisions will survive termination or expiration of this {_Agreement}: (a) any obligation of {_Customer} to pay fees incurred before termination; (b) Articles and Sections {IP.Xnum} ({IP.Ti}), {Conf.Xnum} ({Conf.Ti}), {Rep.WarrantyDisclaimer.Xnum} ({Rep.WarrantyDisclaimer.Ti}), {Indemnify.Xnum} ({Indemnify.Ti}), and {LiabilityLimit.Xnum} ({LiabilityLimit.Ti}); and (c) any other provision of this {_Agreement} that must survive to fulfill its essential purpose.
