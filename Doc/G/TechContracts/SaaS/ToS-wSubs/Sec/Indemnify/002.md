sec={_Customer} shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless {_Provider} and the {_Provider_Associate}s (as defined below) against any “{DefT.Indemnified_Claim},” meaning any third party claim, suit, or proceeding arising out of or related to {_Customer}'s alleged or actual use of, misuse of, or failure to use the {_SaaS}, including without limitation: (a) claims by {_Customer’s_Clients} or other {_Users} or by {_Customer}'s or {_Customer’s_Clients}’ employees; (b) claims related {_Data_Incidents} (as defined below); (c) claims related to infringement or violation of a copyright, trademark, trade secret, or privacy or confidentiality right by written material, images, logos or other content uploaded to the {_SaaS} through {_Customer}’s account, including without limitation by {_Customer_Data}; and (d) claims that use of the {_SaaS} through {_Customer}’s account, including by {_Customer’s_Clients} or other {_Users}, harasses, defames, or defrauds a third party or violates the CAN-Spam Act of 2003 or any other law or restriction on electronic advertising. <span style="text-transform:uppercase">{_Indemnified_Claims} include, without limitation, claims arising out of or related to {_Provider}’s negligence.</span> {_Customer}’s obligations set forth in this Article {Xnum} include, without limitation: (i) settlement at {_Customer}’s expense and payment of judgments finally awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction, as well as payment of court costs and other reasonable expenses; and (ii) reimbursement of reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred before {_Customers}’ assumption of the defense (but not attorneys’ fees incurred thereafter).

A “{DefT.Data_Incident}” is any (1) unauthorized disclosure of, access to, or use of {_Customer_Data}, including without limitation {_Excluded_Data}, or (2) violation of {_Privacy/Security_Law} through {_Customer}’s account. {_Data_Incidents} include, without limitation, such events caused by {_Customer}, by {_Provider}, by {_Customer}’s {_Customers} or other users, by hackers, and by any other third party.)
