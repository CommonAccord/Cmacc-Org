Note=This demo uses the Form 002, which has semantically-named sections and subsections.  That is, the Fee section is included as {Fee.Sec}, the Representations as {Rep.Sec}, etc.  The sections have also been broken into separate files, as /Sec/Fee/002.md, /Sec/Rep/002.md, etc.  This allows easy composition, reuse and recomposition of the sections.  It also allows cross-references to be semantic, e.g., to Section {Fee.Xnum} ({Fee.Ti}).<br>Instead of repeating the deal points here, we reference the original BareParameters.
