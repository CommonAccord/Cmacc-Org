2.sec=If the {_Company} issues securities in its next equity financing after the date hereof (the "{Def.Next_Financing.sec}") that (a) have rights, preferences or privileges that are more favorable than the terms of the shares of {_Series_Seed_Preferred_Stock}, such as price-based anti-dilution protection, or (b) provide all such future investors other contractual terms such as registration rights, the {_Company} will provide substantially equivalent rights to the {_Purchasers} with respect to the shares of {_Series_Seed_Preferred_Stock} (with appropriate adjustment for economic terms or other contractual rights), subject to such {_Purchaser}'s execution of any documents, including, if applicable, investor rights, co-sale, voting, and other agreements, executed by the investors purchasing securities in the {_Next_Financing} (such documents, the "{Def.Next_Financing_Documents.sec}").

In the event of such assignment, each {_Major_Purchaser} will have a right to purchase that portion of the securities proposed to be transferred by such {_Key_Holder} equal to the ratio of (a) the number of shares of {_Common_Stock} issued or issuable upon conversion of the shares of {_Series_Seed_Preferred_Stock} owned by such {_Major_Purchaser}, to (b) the number of shares of {_Common_Stock} issued or issuable upon conversion of the shares of {_Series_Seed_Preferred_Stock} owned by all {_Major_Purchaser}s.
