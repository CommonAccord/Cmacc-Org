### 2.1 Conversion upon a Qualified Financing.


In the event that the Company issues and sells shares of its equity securities ( "**_Equity Securities_**") to investors (the "**_Investors_**") [on or before the Maturity Date][while this Note remains outstanding] in an equity financing with total proceeds to the Company of not less than $[**_________**] (excluding the conversion of the Notes or other convertible securities issued for capital raising purposes (_e.g._, Simple Agreements for Future Equity)) (a "**_Qualified Financing_**"), then the outstanding principal amount of this Note and any unpaid accrued interest shall automatically convert in whole without any further action by the Holder into Equity Securities sold in the Qualified Financing at a conversion price equal to [the cash price paid per share for Equity Securities by the Investors in the Qualified Financing[ multiplied by 0.[*__*].][the lesser of (i) the cash price paid per share for Equity Securities by the Investors in the Qualified Financing[ multiplied by 0.[*__*], and (ii) the quotient resulting from dividing $[*_________*] by the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company [immediately prior to the Qualified Financing ][as of the date of the Note ](assuming conversion of all securities convertible into Common Stock and exercise of all outstanding options and warrants, [including all shares of Common Stock reserved and available for future grant under any equity incentive or similar plan of the Company, and/or any equity incentive or similar plan to be created or increased in connection with the Qualified Financing,] but excluding the shares of equity securities of the Company issuable upon the conversion of Notes or other convertible securities issued for capital raising purposes (_e.g._, Simple Agreements for Future Equity)).]  The issuance of Equity Securities pursuant to the conversion of this Note shall be upon and subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to Equity Securities sold in the Qualified Financing.[Notwithstanding this paragraph, if the conversion price of the Notes as determined pursuant to this paragraph (the "**_Conversion Price_**") is less than the price per share at which Equity Securities are issued in the Qualified Financing, the Company may, solely at its option, elect to convert this Note into shares of a newly created series of preferred stock having the identical rights, privileges, preferences and restrictions as the Equity Securities issued in the Qualified Financing, and otherwise on the same terms and conditions, other than with respect to (if applicable): (i) the per share liquidation preference and the conversion price for purposes of price-based anti-dilution protection, which will equal the Conversion Price; and (ii) the per share dividend, which will be the same percentage of the Conversion Price as applied to determine the per share dividends of the Investors in the Qualified Financing relative to the purchase price paid by the Investors.]

### 2.2 Optional Conversion at non-Qualified Financing. 

In the event the Company consummates, [on or before the Maturity Date][while this Note remains outstanding], an equity financing pursuant to which it sells shares of Preferred Stock in a transaction that does not constitute a Qualified Financing, then the [Majority Holders][Holder] shall have the option to treat such equity financing as a Qualified Financing on the same terms set forth herein.

For purposes of this Note, a "**_Change of Control_**" means (i) a consolidation or merger of the Company with or into any other corporation or other entity or person, or any other corporate reorganization, other than any such consolidation, merger or reorganization in which the shares of capital stock of the Company immediately prior to such consolidation, merger or reorganization continue to represent a majority of the voting power of the surviving entity immediately after such consolidation, merger or reorganization; (ii) any transaction or series of related transactions to which the Company is a party in which in excess of 50% of the Company's voting power is transferred; or (iii) the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the Company's assets, or the exclusive license of all or substantially all of the Company's material intellectual property; provided that a Change of Control shall not include any transaction or series of transactions principally for bona fide equity financing purposes in which cash is received by the Company or any successor, indebtedness of the Company is cancelled or converted or a combination thereof.
