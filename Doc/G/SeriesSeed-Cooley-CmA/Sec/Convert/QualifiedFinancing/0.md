Ti=Conversion upon a Qualified Financing

//=The original section text (far below) was a single block of text.  This divides it into its three sentences.  The second sentence is left as is and the third is only slightly broken up.  The first sentence is a bear.  It contains numerous alternatives and has too many ideas embedded.  To begin to make it readable, we first reduce it to something like a normal sentence with placeholders for the more complex clauses.  Then we break those complex clauses apart on the same principle.  This is still hard to read and follow, but it has structure, can be automated and worked.  It needs more comments, and a rewrite.
