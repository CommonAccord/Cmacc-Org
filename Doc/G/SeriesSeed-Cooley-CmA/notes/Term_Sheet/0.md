//=Optional- alternative Section 1.5 (preceeding).  It is still in raw form. 

Conversion at {_Qualified_Financing}:

In the event the {_Company} consummates, [on or prior to the Maturity Date][while this Note is outstanding], an equity financing pursuant to which it sells shares of its equity securities ("Next Round Securities"), with an aggregate sales price of not less than $________, excluding any and all indebtedness under the Notes that is converted into Next Round Securities, and with the principal purpose of raising capital (a "Qualified Financing"), then all principal, together with all unpaid accrued interest under the Notes, shall automatically convert into shares of Next Round Securities at the lesser of (i) [___]% of ]the cash price per share paid by the other purchasers of Next Round Securities in the Qualified Financing and (ii) the price obtained by dividing $________ by the number of outstanding shares of common stock of the {_Company} [immediately prior to the Qualified Financing][as of the date of the Note] (assuming conversion of all securities convertible into common stock and exercise of all outstanding options and warrants, [including all shares of common stock reserved and available for future grant under any equity incentive or similar plan of the {_Company}, and/or any equity incentive or similar plan to be created or increased in connection with the Qualified Financing,] but excluding the shares of equity securities of the {_Company} issuable upon the conversion of the Notes or other indebtedness). [ If the conversion price of the Notes is less than the cash price per share at which Next Round Securities are issued in the Qualified Financing, the {_Company} may, solely at its option, elect to convert the Notes into shares of a newly created series of capital stock having the identical rights, privileges, preferences and restrictions as the Preferred Stock issued in the Qualified Financing, and otherwise on the same terms and conditions, other than with respect to (if applicable): (i) the per share liquidation preference and the conversion price for purposes of price-based anti-dilution protection, which will equal the conversion price; and (ii) the per share dividend, which will be the same percentage of the conversion price as applied to determine the per share dividends of new investors in the Qualified Financing relative to the purchase price paid by such investors.]]

OptionalConversion.Deciders.Majority.cl=Majority Holders

//=Cf. Promissory Note - "Holder" instead of "Investor".

OptionalConversion.Deciders.EachHolder.cl=each Investor


//=These are left in their raw state.  It seems more sensible to work on the conversion provisions as an independent object, and then transclude them.

1.6.Ti=Conversion at Maturity:

1.6.sec=In the event that the Note remains outstanding on the Maturity Date, then the outstanding principal balance of the Investor's Note and any unpaid accrued interest shall [automatically without any further action by such Investor][upon the election of the Majority Holders][upon the election of such Investor] convert into shares of [the {_Company}'s common stock][a newly created series of the {_Company}'s preferred stock on the terms and conditions set forth on Exhibit A] at a conversion price equal to the quotient resulting from dividing $________ by the number of outstanding shares of common stock of the {_Company} [as of the Maturity Date][as of the date of the Note] (assuming conversion of all securities convertible into common stock and exercise of all outstanding options and warrants,[ including all shares of common stock reserved and available for future grant under any equity incentive or similar plan of the {_Company},] but excluding the shares of equity securities of the {_Company} issuable upon the conversion of the Notes or other indebtedness).]
