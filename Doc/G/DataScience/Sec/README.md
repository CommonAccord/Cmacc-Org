Sec/README.md

This folder is for Sections and other subcomponents of documents.  Notably:

Conf/ || Confidentiality
Dispute/  || Dispute Resolution provisions
Rep/ ||  Representations and Warranties
Cond/ || Conditions

and other components commonly used in legal documents. 

As a start on this taxonomy, see =[G/ABA-MSPA-SPA-CmA/Sec/](http://www.commonaccord.org/i.php?v=l&f=G/ABA-MSPA-SPA-CmA/Sec/)


We need to work out how to organize the subfolders.
