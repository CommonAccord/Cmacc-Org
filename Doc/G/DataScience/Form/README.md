Form/README.md

This folder is for "Form" documents.  Notably:

Policies
Licenses
Consents
Contribution Agreements

and other documents commonly used in data science. 

As a start on the kinds of documents, see =[S/Index/DataSharing/](http://www.commonaccord.org/index.php?action=list&file=S/Index/DataSharing/)


The subfolders for documents will be organized first by language (EN/ or FR/ etc.), then by jurisdiction (US/DE or CH) then by subject matter.  Wherever there is an existing GitHub-based project, we will try to use the project repo's name, and likely will mount it separately as G/NativeProjectName. We will link to it from this G/DataScience/Form/....  (The hope is to play well with others, to encourage independent development, for projects to be developed and maintained by their authors and sponsors.)
