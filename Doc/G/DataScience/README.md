A kernel of Git-Based legal management for Data Science


This repo sketches a general solution to legal documents for data science.  It iterates a top-level classification system (ontology), has links to resources and has candidate model forms expressed in ProseObject format.

It furthers the vision of Block Science Labs and legal codification. http://blog.blocksciencelabs.com/blockscience-labs-launches-partnership-with-commonaccord/

The ProseObject documents will also be available in rendering form at http://www.commonaccord.org/index.php?action=list&file=G/DataScience/

There is a chat/spec document at =[G/DataScience/FEEDME.md](FEEDME.md)
