Duty.1.2.Ti=(b) {_Stakeholder} engagement:

Note="Clause" is used instead of "Section" or "Article".  Inconsistency.

Duty.1.2.sec={_Buyer} and {_Supplier} must engage {_Stakeholders} at each step of the {_HREDD} process set out in Clause {Duty.1.Xnum}.

Duty.1.4.3.sec=(iii) Where {_Buyer} seeks to implement {_HREDD} measures such as, for example, questionnaires, audits, certifications and scorecards, {_Supplier} may, to the extent allowed by applicable law, provide {_Buyer} with a recent equivalent document, and {_Buyer} shall accept such equivalent document [or a portion of the equivalent document] to the extent that it meets the {_Buyer}’s minimum standards, unless {_Buyer} reasonably considers that such document [entirely] fails to satisfy {_Buyer}’s minimum standards.

Duty.1.4.4.sec=(iv) Each party may request additional {_HREDD}-related information, so long as such requests are sufficiently defined, limited in scope, and necessary for the requesting party to effectively carry out its own {_HREDD_Obligations} under the {_Agreement} and under applicable law.

Duty.3.3.2.sec=(ii) If there is a material increase in input costs that increases the risks of {_Adverse_Impacts}, {_Buyer} and {_Supplier} shall collaborate to agree on alternative terms to mitigate such risks and prevent the occurrence of actual {_Adverse_Impacts}. Such alternative terms may include, among other things, price and payment term adjustments, advance payments, credit facilities, schedule changes, and extended contract terms. {_Buyer} may require {_Supplier} to provide documentation of the increase in input costs.

Duty.3.3.=[G/Z/ol-i/s2]

Duty.3.4.Ti=(d) Commercial Terms (Payment and Delivery):

Duty.3.4.sec={_Buyer} shall collaborate with {_Supplier} to agree on commercial terms, including payment, transfer of ownership and risk of loss, and delivery terms, that will support the parties’ performance of their {_HREDD_Obligations}. {_Buyer} and {_Supplier} each agree not to vary the commercial terms of the {_Agreement} unilaterally and to avoid retroactive changes to the commercial terms to the extent such changes would undermine the {_HREDD} process.

Duty.3.5.Ti=(e) Order Changes:

Duty.3.5.sec=For any material change of an order requested by {_Buyer}, the parties, including the {_HREDD_Contact_Points}, shall discuss and consider the potential {_Adverse_Impacts} of such change and take action to avoid or mitigate such potential {_Adverse_Impacts}. Such action may consist of, for example, adjusting the price or the production timeline for the order. [No changes shall be made to an agreed order after production has begun]. [If the order change results in {_Buyer} using __% less of {_Supplier}’s capacity than originally [projected][agreed], {_Buyer} shall pay {_Supplier} for the unused capacity]

Duty.3.6.Ti=(f) Excused Non-Performance by {_Supplier}:

Duty.3.6.sec=If {_Supplier}[‘s {_HREDD_Contact_Point}] provides reasonably satisfactory evidence that an {_Adverse_Impact} is likely to occur because of a requested order change or a change of circumstances materially affecting {_Supplier}, and if the parties cannot agree on a solution that avoids this {_Adverse_Impact}, then {_Supplier} may elect to cease manufacturing the order or its performance of the {_Agreement}. In such a situation, {_Supplier}’s performance shall be excused and it shall not be in default of its obligations under this {_Agreement}.

Duty.3.7.Ti=(g) Positive incentives:

Duty.3.7.sec={_Buyer} shall establish clear and transparent benchmarks to assess {_HREDD} performance. [{_Buyer} shall seek to obtain feedback from {_Supplier} [through the {_HREDD_Contact_Point}] on the benchmarks [annually][twice a year].] Where feasible given {_Buyer}’s other commercial commitments and market demand, {_Supplier} shall be rewarded for {_HREDD} performance that meets or exceeds the benchmarks, for example by prolongation of contracts or assignment of new orders if {_Buyer} needs to source {_Goods}. When determining whether to continue or expand the commercial relationship, {_Buyer} shall give weight to {_HREDD} performance [equal] [as well as] to criteria such as quality, price, and timely delivery.

Duty.4.1.2.sec=(ii) {_Stakeholders} bringing concerns and grievances through the {_OLGM}[s] shall be entitled to appropriate follow-up and, if appropriate, to meet with the {_HREDD_Contact_Points} and other relevant {_Buyer} and {_Supplier} representative(s) to discuss the {_Adverse_Impacts} at issue and a way forward for addressing such Impacts.

Duty.4.1.=[G/Z/ol-i/s2]

Duty.4.2.Ti=(b) {_OLGM} Reporting Requirements:

Duty.4.2.sec=[To the extent allowed by law,] [{_Buyer} shall inform {_Supplier}] [{_Buyer} and {_Supplier} shall inform each other] about the functioning of the {_OLGM}[s] by providing [annual] [semi-annual][monthly][__] written reports, describing, at a minimum, the number and nature of grievances received and processed over the reporting period, the extent of the consultations with {_Stakeholders}, and all actions taken or planned to address such grievances.

Duty.4.3.Ti=(c) Relationship to Other Mechanisms:

Duty.4.3.sec=[{_Buyer}][{_Buyer} and {_Supplier}] shall ensure that {_Stakeholders} have access to the {_OLGM}[s] regardless of whether they have filed or intend to file a grievance through another grievance mechanism or to commence legal proceedings.
