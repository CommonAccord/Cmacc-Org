1.Ti=Collectibles 

1.1.sec=“Collectible” means the combination of: (A) an Ethereum-based NFT having a Uniform Resource Identifier (“URI”) identifying an appropriately configured JSON file conforming to the ERC-721 Metadata JSON Schema, ERC-1155 Metadata URI JSON Schema or a similar JSON schema, as applicable (such JSON file, the “Collectible ID”); and (B) the Collectible Metadata specified by such Collectible ID. 

1.2.sec=The Collectible ID of a Collectible specifies the properties of the Collectible, including the name and description of the Collectible (the “Collectible Descriptors”), a URI identifying a file storing a photograph, illustration, image, vector, video, 3D asset, template asset, or other pictorial or graphic work associated with the Collectible (the “Collectible Image”) and potentially other metadata associated with the Collectible (the Collectible Descriptors, Collectible Image and such other metadata, collectively, the “Collectible Metadata”). 

1.3.sec=“Collector” of a Collectible means at each time, the person who lawfully holds exclusive title to and ownership of the NFT included in such Collectible, for so long as such person continues to hold such title to and ownership of such NFT. All references to “Collector” include the Collector’s lawful permitted successors and assigns. In the event of an Ethereum Persistent Fork creating copies of the Collectibles at the same addresses at which they were then held on Ethereum, the scope of the term “Collector,” and all licenses granted to and other rights of a Collector under these Terms, shall be deemed expanded to include each person who lawfully holds exclusive title to and ownership of the copies of such NFTs that are included on the Ethereum Persistent Fork. The parties acknowledge and agree that, as a result of the preceding sentence, in an Ethereum Persistent Fork, the aggregate number of the Collectibles may be increased, which could have an adverse effect on the value of each Collectible or the aggregate value of the total Collectibles.

1.4.sec=“Ethereum” means the Ethereum mainnet and the consensus blockchain for such mainnet (networkID:1, chainID:1) as recognized by the official Go Ethereum Client, or, if applicable, the network and blockchain generally recognized as the legitimate successor thereto.

1.5.sec=“Ethereum Persistent Fork” means an Ethereum network and blockchain generally recognized in the blockchain industry as the mainnet and consensus blockchain of a persistent “contentious hardfork” from Ethereum, provided that such hardfork has or would reasonably be expected to have material value independent from Ethereum.

1.6.sec=“NFTs” means any Ethereum-based tokens complying with the ERC-721 standard, ERC-1155 standard or other similar non-fungible token standard.

2.sec=The Creator hereby represents and warrants, to and for the benefit of the Collector and each Sublicensee that: (a) the Collectible Image is an original work of authorship by the Creator or an original work of authorship by a person from whom Creator has a valid and enforceable license permitting the Creator to license the Collectible Image to others upon the terms and subject to the conditions of these Terms; (b) the Collector’s ownership of the NFT and use of the Collectible Image and Collectible in accordance with these Terms will be free and clear of all additional claims, encumbrances, liens and security interests of any kind; and (c) the Collectible Image and the Collectible do not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate any intellectual property or other right of any third party. If the Collectible Image is licensed to the Creator, then: (x) Creator hereby represents and warrants that it is acting on behalf of, and with all necessary and desirable authorization from, the licensors; and (y) to the extent permitted by law, all other references to the “Creator” in these Terms shall be deemed to include such licensors, including, without limitation for purposes of every grant of rights made by ‘the Creator’ hereunder. Except as expressly granted in these Terms, the Creator retains all rights, title, and interest in and to the Collectible Images.

3.1.0.sec=For the promises received and given and other good and valuable consideration, including the purchase price, if any, paid for the Collectible, the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Creator hereby grants to each Collector a license to the Collectible Image, upon the following terms and conditions and the other terms and conditions of these Terms: 

3.1.1.sec=The license is perpetual, fully paid up and worldwide.

3.1.4.sec=The Collector may sell, transfer, or assign all (but not less than all) of its right, title, and interest in and to the NFT associated with the Collectible (a “Resale”), and upon such Resale, all of the Collector’s rights and interests in and to the Collectible, including all of the Collector’s rights and interests in and to the Collectible Image, will be considered sold, transferred, or assigned, as the case may be, to the buyer, transferee, or assignee of such NFT along with the NFT itself (the “Resale Right”). The Collector’s rights, title and interest in the Collectible may not be assigned, sold or transferred, in whole or in part, to any person and the Resale Right may not be exercised, in whole or in part, without a sale and transfer of the NFT associated with the Collectible to the assignee, purchaser or transferee, as applicable.

3.1.5.sec=The Collector may sublicense the Collector’s Personal Use Rights in the Collectible Image to the lawful operators of websites, the user interfaces of software applications, virtual museums or virtual galleries, or physical museums or physical galleries (if such physical museum or physical gallery solely displays the Collectible Image on a screen while the NFT is held in escrow for such purpose) (“Sublicensees”), in each case, for the purposes of: (A) displaying the Collectible Image as part of the Collectible to the public for educational, non-commercial or cultural purposes without any compensation being paid to the Collector; or (B) displaying the Collectible in connection with sale, trading or transfer transactions in the Collectible in accordance with the Resale Right.

Notwithstanding the otherwise personal and non-commercial nature of the Personal Use Right and the restrictions set forth in Section 4, the use of the Collectible Image by a Sublicensee consistent with the uses stated in this paragraph may have a commercial purpose for the Sublicensee pursuant to its general business of displaying and facilitating trading in images and other information regarding NFT-based art collectibles, promoting such business and collecting fees or commissions in connection with such business.

7.6.2.sec=If any court or arbitrator makes a final, binding and non-appealable determination that the class action waiver set forth in this Section 7.6 is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void with respect to any Dispute that would thus be required to be resolved by arbitration on a class basis, and the parties shall be deemed to have agreed not to arbitrate such Dispute. In the event that, as a result of the application of the immediately preceding sentence or otherwise, any Dispute is not subject to arbitration, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the federal and state courts located in Wilmington, Delaware and to accept service of process by mail with respect to such Dispute, and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available with respect to such Dispute.
