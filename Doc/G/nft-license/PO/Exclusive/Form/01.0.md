Collectible.Ti=Collectibles 

Collectible.1.sec=“{DefT.Collectible}” means the combination of: (A) an Ethereum-based {_NFT} having a Uniform Resource Identifier (“URI”) identifying an appropriately configured JSON file conforming to the ERC-721 Metadata JSON Schema, ERC-1155 Metadata URI JSON Schema or a similar JSON schema, as applicable (such JSON file, the “Collectible ID”); and (B) the Collectible Metadata specified by such Collectible ID. 

Collectible.2.sec=The Collectible ID of a Collectible specifies the properties of the Collectible, including the name and description of the Collectible (the “Collectible Descriptors”), a URI identifying a file storing a photograph, illustration, image, vector, video, 3D asset, template asset, or other pictorial or graphic work associated with the Collectible (the “{DefT.Collectible_Image}”) and potentially other metadata associated with the Collectible (the Collectible Descriptors, Collectible Image and such other metadata, collectively, the “Collectible Metadata”). 

Collectible.3.sec=“{DefT.Collector}” of a Collectible means at each time, the person who lawfully holds exclusive title to and ownership of the {_NFT} included in such Collectible, for so long as such person continues to hold such title to and ownership of such {_NFT}. All references to “Collector” include the Collector’s lawful permitted successors and assigns. In the event of an Ethereum Persistent Fork creating copies of the Collectibles at the same addresses at which they were then held on Ethereum, the scope of the term “Collector,” and all licenses granted to and other rights of a Collector under these Terms, shall be deemed expanded to include each person who lawfully holds exclusive title to and ownership of the copies of such {_NFT}s that are included on the Ethereum Persistent Fork. The parties acknowledge and agree that, as a result of the preceding sentence, in an Ethereum Persistent Fork, the aggregate number of the Collectibles may be increased, which could have an adverse effect on the value of each Collectible or the aggregate value of the total Collectibles.

Collectible.4.sec=“Ethereum” means the Ethereum mainnet and the consensus blockchain for such mainnet (networkID:1, chainID:1) as recognized by the official Go Ethereum Client, or, if applicable, the network and blockchain generally recognized as the legitimate successor thereto.

Collectible.5.sec=“Ethereum Persistent Fork” means an Ethereum network and blockchain generally recognized in the blockchain industry as the mainnet and consensus blockchain of a persistent “contentious hardfork” from Ethereum, provided that such hardfork has or would reasonably be expected to have material value independent from Ethereum.

Collectible.6.sec=“{DefT.NFT}s” means any Ethereum-based tokens complying with the ERC-721 standard, ERC-1155 standard or other similar non-fungible token standard.
