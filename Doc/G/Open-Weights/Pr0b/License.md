0.sec=Version 1.0.0

Scope.Ti=Scope

License.sec=The licensor grants you the rights to do everything with the licensed elements that would otherwise infringe that contributorâ€™s intellectual property rights, including without limitation copyright, patent rights, and trade secret rights. However, this license grants you no trademark or publicity rights.

Notice.Ti=Notices

Notice.sec=If you modify the licensed elements and provide them to others, you may apply terms of your choice; however, if you provide any of the licensed elements to others in a manner that requires the license granted above, you must inform the recipient that the elements are available under this license, either by providing a copy of this license, or a reference to <a href="https://github.com/Open-Weights/Definition/blob/main/Open%20Weights%20License.MD">https://github.com/Open-Weights/Definition/blob/main/Open%20Weights%20License.MD</a>.

If local law prohibits this limitation of liability, or disclaimer of warranty or condition, this license will be null and void.

CodersNote=The URL is expressed here as a full href link, because simple references to URLs are not automatically converted to links in CommonAccord rendering (no markdown magic like on GitHub).

CodersNote=Mechanics, mostly to use meaningful section names.
