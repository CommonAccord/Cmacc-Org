This updates the Pr0b versions of the Definition.md and the License.md to the version current at https://github.com/Open-Weights/Definition as of 2021-11-01. (https://github.com/Open-Weights/Definition/commit/099e23251456032d2edf30b330c3d790acdb78c3)

In making the updates, a few notes:

The Definition.md was changed substantially, including with the addition of optional elements.  Instead of reworking my prior version, I took the current original from Open-Weights and converted it to the ProseObject format mostly via GitHub Copilot. In doing so, we (Copilot and me) simply numbered each element and subelement, rather than use the semantic names of the prior ProseObject version. In listing the elements, we used a numbered list (with 1, 2, 3 for the elements and a., b., c. for the subelements) in order to make referencing easier.  I gave Copilot a few suggestions about keys, corrected a few things, and prompted it to do an All.Sec which has all the elements and a Mandatory.Sec, which has ... the mandatory elements only.  I reformated the footnote to become a hyperlink in my usual format.  But Copilot did most of the work. 

For the License.md, the changes were minor and discrete.  I just pasted the couple of changes current version from Open-Weights.

A couple of examples:

Definition.md with only mandatory elements: <a href="http://www.commonaccord.org/i.php?v=d&f=G/Open-Weights/Pr0b/Definition.md&k=Mandatory.Sec">http://www.commonaccord.org/i.php?v=d&f=G/Open-Weights/Pr0b/Definition.md&k=Mandatory.Sec</a>

With All elements: <a href="http://www.commonaccord.org/i.php?v=d&f=G/Open-Weights/Pr0b/Definition.md&k=All.Sec">http://www.commonaccord.org/i.php?v=d&f=G/Open-Weights/Pr0b/Definition.md&k=All.Sec</a>



Prior README.md Was: 

This demos the ProseObject format for the Definition and the License.  A few notes:

The license is renamed "License.md", dropping the "Open Weights" part as redundant, removing spaces as inconvenient, and making the .MD lowercase for consistency.
