Ti=Article 4

1.sec=In order to achieve the long-term temperature goal set out in Article 2, {Parties} aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, recognizing that peaking will take longer for {developing_country_Parties}, and to undertake rapid reductions thereafter in accordance with best available science, so as to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century, on the basis of equity, and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty.

2.sec=Each {Party} shall prepare, communicate and maintain successive nationally determined contributions that it intends to achieve. {Parties} shall pursue domestic mitigation measures, with the aim of achieving the objectives of such contributions.

3.sec=Each {Party}’s successive nationally determined contribution will represent a progression beyond the {Party}’s then current nationally determined contribution and reflect its highest possible ambition, reflecting its common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances.

5.sec=Support shall be provided to {developing_country_Parties} for the implementation of this Article, in accordance with Articles 9, 10 and 11, recognizing that enhanced support for {developing_country_Parties} will allow for higher ambition in their actions. 

6.sec=The least developed countries and small island developing States may prepare and communicate strategies, plans and actions for low greenhouse gas emissions development reflecting their special circumstances.

7.sec=Mitigation co-benefits resulting from {Parties}’ adaptation actions and/or economic diversification plans can contribute to mitigation outcomes under this Article.

8.sec=In communicating their nationally determined contributions, all {Parties} shall provide the information necessary for clarity, transparency and understanding in accordance with decision 1/CP.21 and any relevant decisions of the {Conference_of_the_Parties} serving as the meeting of the {Parties_to_the_Paris_Agreement}.

9.sec=Each {Party} shall communicate a nationally determined contribution every five years in accordance with decision 1/CP.21 and any relevant decisions of the {Conference_of_the_Parties} serving as the meeting of the {Parties_to_the_Paris_Agreement} and be informed by the outcomes of the global stocktake referred to in Article 14.

10.sec=The {Conference_of_the_Parties} serving as the meeting of the {Parties_to_the_Paris_Agreement} shall consider common time frames for nationally determined contributions at its first session.

11.sec=A {Party} may at any time adjust its existing nationally determined contribution with a view to enhancing its level of ambition, in accordance with guidance adopted by the {Conference_of_the_Parties} serving as the meeting of the {Parties_to_the_Paris_Agreement}.

12.sec=Nationally determined contributions communicated by {Parties} shall be recorded in a public registry maintained by the secretariat.

13.sec={Parties} shall account for their nationally determined contributions. In accounting for anthropogenic emissions and removals corresponding to their nationally determined contributions, {Parties} shall promote environmental integrity, transparency, accuracy, completeness, comparability and consistency, and ensure the avoidance of double counting, in accordance with guidance adopted by the {Conference_of_the_Parties} serving as the meeting of the {Parties_to_the_Paris_Agreement}.

14.sec=In the context of their nationally determined contributions, when recognizing and implementing mitigation actions with respect to anthropogenic emissions and removals, {Parties} should take into account, as appropriate, existing methods and guidance under {the_Convention}, in the light of the provisions of paragraph 13 of this Article.

15.sec={Parties} shall take into consideration in the implementation of {this_Agreement} the concerns of {Parties} with economies most affected by the impacts of response measures, particularly {developing_country_Parties}.

16.sec={Parties}, including regional economic integration organizations and their member States, that have reached an agreement to act jointly under paragraph 2 of this Article shall notify the secretariat of the terms of that agreement, including the emission level allocated to each {Party} within the relevant time period, when they communicate their nationally determined contributions. The secretariat shall in turn inform the {Parties} and signatories to {the_Convention} of the terms of that agreement.

17.sec=Each party to such an agreement shall be responsible for its emission level as set out in the agreement referred to in paragraph 16 above in accordance with paragraphs 13 and 14 of this Article and Articles 13 and 15.

18.sec=If {Parties} acting jointly do so in the framework of, and together with, a regional economic integration organization which is itself a {Party_to_this_Agreement}, each member State of that regional economic integration organization individually, and together with the regional economic integration organization, shall be responsible for its emission level as set out in the agreement communicated under paragraph 16 of this Article in accordance with paragraphs 13 and 14 of this Article and Articles 13 and 15.

19.sec=All {Parties} should strive to formulate and communicate long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies, mindful of Article 2 taking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances.
