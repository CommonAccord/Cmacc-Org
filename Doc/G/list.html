This is a collection of "prose objects," codified legal documents, forms and widgets.  They can be the source code for the legal part of transacting.  The goal is to codify and "code-ify" law.

You can use these prose objects privately by creating an "instance" of CommonAccord - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-06FzulLpQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-06FzulLpQ</a>.<br>

Transacting platforms can integrate them by writing their own rendering engine.  If you are interested in this, please contact us as we would like to start a standards process for the data model. <br>

We expect that these will be used with smart contracts to fully automate and open source transacting in a P2P arrangement.  The phrase "prose" object comes from Ian Grigg's "Ricardian contracts."<br> 

The names of these objects are improvised and will change.  GitHub has a nice way of forwarding from an old name to a new one.  But they will all be here, as well as on GitHub.  <a href="index.php?action=list&file=G/Acme-Ang-YC-Note-CmA/">Acme-Ang-YC-Note-CmA/</a> has some explanation.
