Pleading.Title.Long=STIPULATED PROTECTIVE ORDER FOR LITIGATION INVOLVING PATENTS, HIGHLY SENSITIVE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND/OR TRADE SECRETS

Purpose.Sec=<b>PURPOSES AND LIMITATIONS</b><br>Disclosure and discovery activity in this action are likely to involve production of confidential, proprietary, or private information for which special protection from public disclosure and from use for any purpose other than prosecuting this litigation may be warranted. Accordingly, the parties hereby stipulate to and petition the court to enter the following Stipulated Protective Order. The parties acknowledge that this Order does not confer blanket protections on all disclosures or responses to discovery and that the protection it affords from public disclosure and use extends only to the limited information or items that are entitled to confidential treatment under the applicable legal principles. The parties further acknowledge, as set forth in Section {14.4} below, that this Stipulated Protective Order does not entitle them to file confidential information under seal; {Civil Local Rule 79-5} sets forth the procedures that must be followed and the standards that will be applied when a party seeks permission from the court to file material under seal.

Scope.Sec=<b>SCOPE</b><br>The protections conferred by this Stipulation and Order cover not only {Protected Material} (as defined above), but also (1) any information copied or extracted from {Protected Material}; (2) all copies, excerpts, summaries, or compilations of {Protected Material}; and (3) any testimony, conversations, or presentations by Parties or their {Counsel} that might reveal {Protected Material}. However, the protections conferred by this Stipulation and Order do not cover the following information: (a) any information that is in the public domain at the time of disclosure to a {Receiving Party} or becomes part of the public domain after its disclosure to a {Receiving Party} as a result of publication not involving a violation of this Order, including becoming part of the public record through trial or otherwise; and (b) any information known to the {Receiving Party} prior to the disclosure or obtained by the {Receiving Party} after the disclosure from a source who obtained the information lawfully and under no obligation of confidentiality to the {Designating Party}. Any use of {Protected Material} at trial shall be governed by a separate agreement or order.

Duration.Sec=<b>DURATION</b><br>Even after final disposition of this litigation, the confidentiality obligations imposed by this Order shall remain in effect until a {Designating Party} agrees otherwise in writing or a court order otherwise directs. Final disposition shall be deemed to be the later of (1) dismissal of all claims and defenses in this action, with or without prejudice; and (2) final judgment herein after the completion and exhaustion of all appeals, rehearings, remands, trials, or reviews of this action, including the time limits for filing any motions or applications for extension of time pursuant to applicable law.

Designate.WithRestraint.Sec=<b>Exercise of Restraint and Care in Designating Material for Protection</b><br> Each {Party} or {Non-Party} that designates information or items for protection under this Order must take care to limit any such designation to specific material that qualifies under the appropriate standards. To the extent it is practical to do so, the {Designating Party} must designate for protection only those parts of material, documents, items, or oral or written communications that qualify - so that other portions of the material, documents, items, or communications for which protection is not warranted are not swept unjustifiably within the ambit of this Order.<br>Mass, indiscriminate, or routinized designations are prohibited. Designations that are shown to be clearly unjustified or that have been made for an improper purpose (e.g., to unnecessarily encumber or retard the case development process or to impose unnecessary expenses and burdens on other parties) expose the {Designating Party} to sanctions.<br>If it comes to a {Designating Party}'s attention that information or items that it designated for protection do not qualify for protection {C.2,or3.Designate.Correction}, that {Designating Party} must promptly notify all other Parties that it is withdrawing the mistaken designation.

C.2,or3.Designate.Correction=at all or do not qualify for the level of protection initially asserted

Designate.Manner.Sec=<b>Manner and Timing of Designations</b><br> Except as otherwise provided in this Order (see, e.g., second paragraph of section {5.2(a)} below), or as otherwise stipulated or ordered, {Disclosure or Discovery Material} that qualifies for protection under this Order must be clearly so designated before the material is disclosed or produced.<br>Designation in conformity with this Order requires:<ol><li>{Designate.Manner.Docs.Sec}</li><li>{Designate.Manner.Testimony.Sec}</li><li>{Designate.Manner.Other.Sec}</li></ol>

Designate.Manner.Docs.Sec=for information in documentary form (e.g., paper or electronic documents, but excluding transcripts of depositions or other pretrial or trial proceedings), that the {Producing Party} affix the legend {C.1,2,or3} to each page that contains {Protected Material}. If only a portion or portions of the material on a page qualifies for protection, the {Producing Party} also must clearly identify the protected portion(s) (e.g., by making appropriate markings in the margins){C.2or3.Designate.Manner.Docs}.<br>A {Party} or {Non-Party} that makes original documents or materials available for inspection need not designate them for protection until after the inspecting {Party} has indicated which material it would like copied and produced. During the inspection and before the designation, all of the material made available for inspection shall be deemed {C.2.} After the inspecting {Party} has identified the documents it wants copied and produced, the {Producing Party} must determine which documents, or portions thereof, qualify for protection under this Order. Then, before producing the specified documents, the {Producing Party} must affix the {C.2or3.Designate.Legend} to each page that contains {Protected Material}. If only a portion or portions of the material on a page qualifies for protection, the {Producing Party} also must clearly identify the protected portion(s) (e.g., by making appropriate markings in the margins){C.2or3.Designate.Manner.Docs}.

C.2or3.Designate.Manner.Docs= and must specify, for each portion, the level of protection being asserted

C.2or3.Designate.Legend=appropriate legend ({C.1,2,or3})

Designate.Manner.Testimony.Sec=for testimony given in deposition or in other pretrial or trial proceedings, that the {Designating Party} identify on the record, before the close of the deposition, hearing, or other proceeding, all protected testimony and specify the level of protection being asserted. When it is impractical to identify separately each portion of testimony that is entitled to protection and it appears that substantial portions of the testimony may qualify for protection, the {Designating Party} may invoke on the record (before the deposition, hearing, or other proceeding is concluded) a right to have up to 21 days to identify the specific portions of the testimony as to which protection is sought and to specify the level of protection being asserted. Only those portions of the testimony that are appropriately designated for protection within the 21 days shall be covered by the provisions of this Stipulated Protective Order. Alternatively, a {Designating Party} may specify, at the deposition or up to 21 days afterwards if that period is properly invoked, that the entire transcript shall be treated as {C.1or2.}<br>Parties shall give the other parties notice if they reasonably expect a deposition, hearing, or other proceeding to include {Protected Material} so that the other parties can ensure that only authorized individuals who have signed the {Agt2Bind.ExhA} are present at those proceedings. The use of a document as an exhibit at a deposition shall not in any way affect its designation as {C.1or2.}<br>Transcripts containing {Protected Material} shall have an obvious legend on the title page that the transcript contains {Protected Material}, and the title page shall be followed by a list of all pages (including line numbers as appropriate) that have been designated as {Protected Material} and the level of protection being asserted by the {Designating Party}. The {Designating Party} shall inform the court reporter of these requirements. Any transcript that is prepared before the expiration of a 21-day period for designation shall be treated during that period as if it had been designated {C.2} in its entirety unless otherwise agreed. After the expiration of that period, the transcript shall be treated only as actually designated.
Designate.Manner.Other.Sec=for information produced in some form other than documentary and for any other tangible items, that the {Producing Party} affix in a prominent place on the exterior of the container or containers in which the information or item is stored the legend {C.1,2,or3.} If only a portion or portions of the information or item warrant protection, the {Producing Party}, to the extent practicable, shall identify the protected portion(s){C.2or3.Designate.Manner.Other}.

C.2or3.Designate.Manner.Other= and specify the level of protection being asserted

Designate.Failure.Sec=<b>Inadvertent Failures to Designate</b><br> If timely corrected, an inadvertent failure to designate qualified information or items does not, standing alone, waive the {Designating Party}'s right to secure protection under this Order for such material. Upon timely correction of a designation, the {Receiving Party} must make reasonable efforts to assure that the material is treated in accordance with the provisions of this Order.

Challenge.Timing.Sec=<b>Timing of Challenges</b><br> Any {Party} or {Non-Party} may challenge a designation of confidentiality at any time. Unless a prompt challenge to a {Designating Party}'s confidentiality designation is necessary to avoid foreseeable, substantial unfairness, unnecessary economic burdens, or a significant disruption or delay of the litigation, a {Party} does not waive its right to challenge a confidentiality designation by electing not to mount a challenge promptly after the original designation is disclosed.

Challenge.Confer.Sec=<b>Meet and Confer</b><br> The {Challenging Party} shall initiate the dispute resolution process by providing written notice of each designation it is challenging and describing the basis for each challenge. To avoid ambiguity as to whether a challenge has been made, the written notice must recite that the challenge to confidentiality is being made in accordance with this specific paragraph of the Protective Order. The parties shall attempt to resolve each challenge in good faith and must begin the process by conferring directly (in voice to voice dialogue; other forms of communication are not sufficient) within 14 days of the date of service of notice. In conferring, the {Challenging Party} must explain the basis for its belief that the confidentiality designation was not proper and must give the {Designating Party} an opportunity to review the designated material, to reconsider the circumstances, and, if no change in designation is offered, to explain the basis for the chosen designation. A {Challenging Party} may proceed to the next stage of the challenge process only if it has engaged in this meet and confer process first or establishes that the {Designating Party} is unwilling to participate in the meet and confer process in a timely manner.

Challenge.Judge.Sec=<b>Judicial Intervention</b><br> If the {Parties} cannot resolve a challenge without court intervention, the {Designating Party} shall file and serve a motion to retain confidentiality under {Civil Local Rule 7} (and in compliance with {Civil Local Rule 79-5}, if applicable) within 21 days of the initial notice of challenge or within 14 days of the parties agreeing that the meet and confer process will not resolve their dispute, whichever is earlier. Each such motion must be accompanied by a competent declaration affirming that the movant has complied with the meet and confer requirements imposed in the preceding paragraph. Failure by the {Designating Party} to make such a motion including the required declaration within 21 days (or 14 days, if applicable) shall automatically waive the confidentiality designation for each challenged designation. In addition, the {Challenging Party} may file a motion challenging a confidentiality designation at any time if there is good cause for doing so, including a challenge to the designation of a deposition transcript or any portions thereof. Any motion brought pursuant to this provision must be accompanied by a competent declaration affirming that the movant has complied with the meet and confer requirements imposed by the preceding paragraph.<br>The burden of persuasion in any such challenge proceeding shall be on the {Designating Party}. Frivolous challenges and those made for an improper purpose (e.g., to harass or impose unnecessary expenses and burdens on other parties) may expose the {Challenging Party} to sanctions. Unless the {Designating Party} has waived the confidentiality designation by failing to file a motion to retain confidentiality as described above, all parties shall continue to afford the material in question the level of protection to which it is entitled under the {Producing Party}'s designation until the court rules on the challenge.

Access.Principle.Sec=<b>Basic Principles</b><br> A {Receiving Party} may use {Protected Material} that is disclosed or produced by another {Party} or by a {Non-Party} in connection with this case only for prosecuting, defending, or attempting to settle this litigation. Such {Protected Material} may be disclosed only to the categories of persons and under the conditions described in this Order. When the litigation has been terminated, a {Receiving Party} must comply with the provisions of section {15} below (FINAL DISPOSITION).<br>{Protected Material} must be stored and maintained by a {Receiving Party} at a location and in a secure manner that ensures that access is limited to the persons authorized under this Order.

Non-PartyInfo.Procedure.Sec=In the event that a {Party} is required, by a valid discovery request, to produce a {Non-Party}'s confidential information in its possession, and the {Party} is subject to an agreement with the {Non-Party} not to produce the {Non-Party}'s confidential information, then the {Party} shall:<ol><li>{Non-PartyInfo.Procedure.Notify.Sec};</li><li>{Non-PartyInfo.Procedure.InformNon-Party.Sec}; and</li><li>{Non-PartyInfo.Procedure.PermitNon-PartyAccess.Sec}.</li></ol>

If the {Non-Party} timely seeks a protective order, the {Receiving Party} shall not produce any information in its possession or control that is subject to the confidentiality agreement with the {Non-Party} before a determination by the court.  Absent a court order to the contrary, the {Non-Party} shall bear the burden and expense of seeking protection in this court of its {Protected Material}.

Leak.Sec=<b>UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF {PROTECTED MATERIAL}</b><br>If a {Receiving Party} learns that, by inadvertence or otherwise, it has disclosed {Protected Material} to any person or in any circumstance not authorized under this Stipulated Protective Order, the {Receiving Party} must immediately (a) notify in writing the {Designating Party} of the unauthorized disclosures, (b) use its best efforts to retrieve all unauthorized copies of the {Protected Material}, (c) inform the person or persons to whom unauthorized disclosures were made of all the terms of this Order, and (d) request such person or persons to execute the {Agt2Bind.AsExhA}.

This provision is not intended to modify whatever procedure may be established in an e-discovery order that provides for production without prior privilege review. Pursuant to {FRE 502(d) and (e)}, insofar as the parties reach an agreement on the effect of disclosure of a communication or information covered by the attorney-client privilege or work product protection, the parties may incorporate their agreement in the stipulated protective order submitted to the court.

Misc.FurtherRelief.Sec=<b>Right to Further Relief</b><br> Nothing in this Order abridges the right of any person to seek its modification by the court in the future.

Misc.OtherObjection.Sec=<b>Right to Assert Other Objections</b><br> By stipulating to the entry of this Protective Order no {Party} waives any right it otherwise would have to object to disclosing or producing any information or item on any ground not addressed in this Stipulated Protective Order.

Misc.ExportControl.Sec=<b>Export Control</b><br> Disclosure of {Protected Material} shall be subject to all applicable laws and regulations relating to the export of technical data contained in such {Protected Material}, including the release of such technical data to foreign persons or nationals in the United States or elsewhere. The {Producing Party} shall be responsible for identifying any such controlled technical data, and the {Receiving Party} shall take measures necessary to ensure compliance.

Misc.NoOpenFiling.Sec=<b>Filing {Protected Material}</b><br> Without written permission from the {Designating Party} or a court order secured after appropriate notice to all interested persons, a {Party} may not file in the public record in this action any {Protected Material}. A {Party} that seeks to file under seal any {Protected Material} must comply with {Civil Local Rule 79-5}. {Protected Material} may only be filed under seal pursuant to a court order authorizing the sealing of the specific {Protected Material} at issue. Pursuant to {Civil Local Rule 79-5}, a sealing order will issue only upon a request establishing that the {Protected Material} at issue is privileged, protectable as a trade secret, or otherwise entitled to protection under the law. If a {Receiving Party}'s request to file {Protected Material} under seal pursuant to {Civil Local Rule 79-5(e)} is denied by the court, then the {Receiving Party} may file the {Protected Material} in the public record pursuant to {Civil Local Rule 79-5(e)(2)} unless otherwise instructed by the court.

FinalDisposition.Sec=<b>FINAL DISPOSITION</b><br>Within 60 days after the final disposition of this action, as defined in paragraph {4}, each {Receiving Party} must return all {Protected Material} to the {Producing Party} or destroy such material. As used in this subdivision, "all {Protected Material}" includes all copies, abstracts, compilations, summaries, and any other format reproducing or capturing any of the {Protected Material}. Whether the {Protected Material} is returned or destroyed, the {Receiving Party} must submit a written certification to the {Producing Party} (and, if not the same person or entity, to the {Designating Party}) by the 60 day deadline that (1) identifies (by category, where appropriate) all the {Protected Material} that was returned or destroyed and (2) affirms that the {Receiving Party} has not retained any copies, abstracts, compilations, summaries or any other format reproducing or capturing any of the {Protected Material}. Notwithstanding this provision, {Counsel} are entitled to retain an archival copy of all pleadings, motion papers, trial, deposition, and hearing transcripts, legal memoranda, correspondence, deposition and trial exhibits, expert reports, attorney work product, and consultant and expert work product, even if such materials contain {Protected Material}. Any such archival copies that contain or constitute {Protected Material} remain subject to this Protective Order as set forth in Section {4} (DURATION).
