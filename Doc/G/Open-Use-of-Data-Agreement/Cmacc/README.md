This is a fork of https://github.com/microsoft/Open-Use-of-Data-Agreement.

It has exactly the same text as the original (except that Section 2.2.2 is now correctly numbered as 2.1.2).

It has been put into Prose Object format, and modularized as each of its five sections.  The defined terms are now semantically defined links, as are the cross-references to sections.

It can be viewed "in action" at http://www.commonaccord.org/i.php?v=s&f=G/Open-Use-of-Data-Agreement/Cmacc/Form/0.md
