Ti=Redistribution of Data

1.0.sec=You may redistribute the {_Data} under terms of your choice, so long as:

1.1.sec=You include with any {_Data} you redistribute all credit or attribution information that you received with the {_Data}, and your terms require any {_Downstream_Recipient} to do the same; and

1.2.sec=Your terms include a warranty disclaimer and limitation of liability for {_Upstream_Data_Providers} at least as broad as those contained in Section {Limit.Data-AsIs.Xnum} and {Limit.Damage-Disclaim.Xnum} of the {_O-UDA}.

Comment=The only requirements for redistributing {_Data} are to maintain attribution (if any) and use an agreement that contains Section {Limit.Xnum}â€™s disclaimers and limitations on liability, so that {_Downstream_Recipients} are bound by it for their use. These two restrictions apply only to the Data, but not to Output. Maintaining attribution is an accepted practice for sharing data to indicate its source or provenance. Requiring the use of disclaimers and liability limitations for subsequent distribution provides further certainty to a Data Provider.
