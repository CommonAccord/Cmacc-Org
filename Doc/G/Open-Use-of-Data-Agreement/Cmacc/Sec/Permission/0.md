Ti=Provision of the Data

1.sec=You may use, modify, and distribute the {_Data} made available to you by the {_Data_Provider} under this {_O-UDA} if you follow the {_O-UDA}'s terms.

Comment=The O-UDA permits very broad use of Data, and also modification and redistribution of the Data, so long as the recipient meets the {_O-UDA}'s requirements (and there are only a few of these). It is styled as a "permission to use" rather than a grant of specific rights, because the rights that may be applicable to any given database (whether copyright, database rights, or merely access rights) may vary around the world.

2.sec={_Data_Provider} will not sue you or any {_Downstream_Recipient} for any claim arising out of the use, modification, or distribution of the {_Data} provided you meet the terms of the {_O-UDA}.

Comment=This is a promise by the Data Provider not to sue the user so long as the user complies with O-UDA’s requirements. It doesn't allow a Data Provider to terminate a permitted use of the Data, but it does allow the Data Provider to bring an action to enforce the {_O-UDA}’s terms.
