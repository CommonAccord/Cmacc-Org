0.sec=Before beginning to initially train a {_covered_model}, the {_developer} shall do all of the following:

1.sec=Implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical cybersecurity protections to prevent unauthorized access to, misuse of, or unsafe {_post-training_modifications} of, the {_covered_model} and all {_covered_model_derivatives} controlled by the {_developer} that are appropriate in light of the risks associated with the {_covered_model}, including from {_advanced_persistent_threats} or other sophisticated actors.

2.1.sec=Implement the capability to promptly enact a {_full_shutdown}.

2.2.sec=When enacting a {_full_shutdown}, the {_developer} shall take into account, as appropriate, the risk that a shutdown of the {_covered_model}, or particular {_covered_model_derivatives}, could cause disruptions to {_critical_infrastructure}.

2.=[G/Z/ol-AA/s2]

3.0.sec=Implement a written and separate {_safety_and_security_protocol} that does all of the following:

3.1.sec=Specifies protections and procedures that, if successfully implemented, would successfully comply with the {_developer}â€™s duty to take reasonable care to avoid producing a {_covered_model} or {_covered_model_derivative} that poses an unreasonable risk of causing or materially enabling a {_critical_harm}.

3.2.sec=States compliance requirements in an objective manner and with sufficient detail and specificity to allow the {_developer} or a third party to readily ascertain whether the requirements of the {_safety_and_security_protocol} have been followed.

3.3.0.sec=Identifies a testing procedure, which takes safeguards into account as appropriate, that takes reasonable care to evaluate if both of the following are true:

3.3.1.sec=A {_covered_model} poses an unreasonable risk of causing or enabling a {_critical_harm}.

3.3.2.sec={_Covered_model_derivatives} pose an unreasonable risk of causing or enabling a {_critical_harm}.

3.3.=[G/Z/ol-i/s2]

3.4.sec=Describes in detail how the testing procedure assesses the risks associated with {_post-training_modifications}.

3.5.sec=Describes in detail how the testing procedure addresses the possibility that a {_covered_model} or {_covered_model_derivative} can be used to make {_post-training_modifications} or create another {_covered_model} in a manner that may cause or materially enable a {_critical_harm}.

3.6.sec=Describes in detail how the {_developer} will fulfill their obligations under this chapter.

3.7.sec=Describes in detail how the {_developer} intends to implement the safeguards and requirements referenced in this section.

3.8.sec=Describes in detail the conditions under which a {_developer} would enact a {_full_shutdown}.

3.9.sec=Describes in detail the procedure by which the {_safety_and_security_protocol} may be modified.

3.=[G/Z/ol-AA/s9]

4.sec=Ensure that the {_safety_and_security_protocol} is implemented as written, including by designating senior {_person}nel to be responsible for ensuring compliance by employees and contractors working on a {_covered_model}, or any {_covered_model_derivatives} controlled by the {_developer}, monitoring and reporting on implementation.

5.sec=Retain an unredacted copy of the {_safety_and_security_protocol} for as long as the {_covered_model} is made available for commercial, public, or foreseeably public use plus five years, including records and dates of any updates or revisions.

6.sec=Conduct an annual review of the {_safety_and_security_protocol} to account for any changes to the capabilities of the {_covered_model} and industry best practices and, if necessary, make modifications to the policy.

7.1.1.sec=Conspicuously publish a copy of the redacted {_safety_and_security_protocol} and transmit a copy of the redacted {_safety_and_security_protocol} to the Attorney General.

7.1.2.0.sec=A redaction in the {_safety_and_security_protocol} may be made only if the redaction is reasonably necessary to protect any of the following:

7.1.2.1.sec=Public safety.

7.1.2.2.sec=Trade secrets, as defined in Section 3426.1 of the Civil Code.

7.1.2.3.sec=Confidential information pursuant to state and federal law.

7.1.2.=[G/Z/ol-II/s3]

7.2.sec=The {_developer} shall grant to the Attorney General access to the unredacted {_safety_and_security_protocol} upon request.

7.3.sec=A {_safety_and_security_protocol} disclosed to the Attorney General pursuant to this paragraph is exempt from the California Public Records Act (Division 10 (commencing with Section 7920.000) of Title 1 of the Government Code).

7.4.sec=If the {_safety_and_security_protocol} is materially modified, conspicuously publish and transmit to the Attorney General an updated redacted copy within 30 days of the modification.

7.=[G/Z/ol-AA/s4]

8.sec=Take reasonable care to implement other appropriate measures to prevent {_covered_models} and {_covered_model_derivatives} from posing unreasonable risks of causing or materially enabling {_critical_harms}.
