This reformats the Bill as it was passed, but not (yet) signed by the Governor.

The reformating is done by hand by copying the text into a plain text file, breaking the file up into subfiles for each section of the law, adding keys and adding the [G/Z/ol/*] widgets that reassemble the document. It could contain errors of assembly, but the correct answers likely are to be found in the source.

The thought is that this law could be used as a model (in the sense of kit, not paradigm) for developing the ideas, vocabulary and ontologies of AI Ethics and the law.
