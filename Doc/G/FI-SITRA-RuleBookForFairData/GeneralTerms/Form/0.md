Def.Ti=DEFINITIONS

Note=We parameterize the Defined Terms by converting "Accession Agreement" to "{_Accession_Agreement}."  (There is no magic to this.  The leading "_" is a convention for signalling that we mean a defined term instead of some data or the like.  It also allows us to reference a library of links using the prefix of "_=[LibraryOfLinks]"  We generate a series of links using one of the options in parser-openedit.pl - which generates them.  Each one of those will link to "Def.*.sec" - e.g. Def.Accession_Agreement.sec.  So we give each of the definitions a matching key and make the whole definitions section into "Def.Sec."  All this allows hyperlinking each defined term to the definition.  (This may sound a bit fiddly, but it is remarkably robust, and enforces discipline about defined terms.

Note="Governance Model" and "List of Members" seem to be defined by not used in this document.  Is it used elsewhere?  "Member" directs to "Party."  "GDPR" directs to "Personal Data".
