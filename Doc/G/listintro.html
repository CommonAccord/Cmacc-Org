This is a collection of "prose objects," codified legal documents, forms and widgets.  
They can be the source code for the legal part of transacting.  
The goal is to codify and "code-ify" law.

You can use these prose objects privately by creating an "instance" of CommonAccord - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-06FzulLpQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-06FzulLpQ</a>.<br>

Transacting platforms can integrate them by writing their own rendering engine.  If you are interested in this, please contact us as we would like to start a standards process for the data model.<br>

We expect that these will be used with smart contracts to fully automate transacting in a P2P arrangement.  The phrase "prose" object comes from Ian Grigg's "Ricardian contracts" and is the same thing as the "wet code" in the wet code/dry code dichotomy of COALA LEX.<br> 

The names of these objects are improvised and will change.  

A headfirst deep-dive into ProseObjects is, for instance:  <a href="i.php?v=l&f=G/Acme-Ang-YC-Note-CmA/">Acme-Ang-YC-Note-CmA/</a> has some explanation.
