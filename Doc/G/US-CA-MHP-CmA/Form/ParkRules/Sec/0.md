1.Ti=INTRODUCTION:

1.sec=The following Rules and Regulations apply to all residents and guests, whether or not signed below, as allowed by law. Residents and guests may only be in the Park and use Park facilities if they comply with these Rules and Regulations and all other conditions of tenancy, whether published or posted. Management will make a reasonable effort to enforce these Rules and Regulations, but Management cannot guarantee that they will be enforced to everyone’s personal satisfaction. The distribution of these Rules and Regulations to any resident or guest is not a commitment that the Park will be any different than any other typical residential community. Just as with any residential area, residents and guests should expect to put up with a reasonable amount of disturbances and other activity that will not be to their liking. When this occurs and you are unreasonably being disturbed, we expect you to make an effort to talk with the person(s) creating the disturbance and try and resolve the problem. If the disturbance requires the police or other public authorities to be contacted, it is also the responsibility of the person being disturbed to contact the appropriate agency and file a complaint. If all reasonable efforts fail and you are truly being affected, on-site management will take steps to try to resolve the problem, upon our receipt of a completed, signed and dated Resident Objection Form (available in the Park office). Please keep in mind, however, that management will not become involved in any matter where a violation of these Rules and Regulations has not occurred. On-site personnel are not responsible to resolve the average day-to-day disturbances or disputes. The Park will not be liable to any resident or guest for any alleged inconsistency in the enforcement of these Rules and Regulations. It is our intention to interpret and apply all Rules and Regulations reasonably and lawfully. If any portion of these Rules and Regulations are deemed to be unlawful, that is the result of an inadvertent mistake and the portion which is unlawful will be automatically deleted without further action on our part, but all of the remaining rules will remain in full force and effect.

We reserve the right to deny any resident a pet, and/or revoke previous authorization to have a pet if the animal appears to present a threat to the health and safety or general welfare of the Park and/or its residents. The types of pets permitted are dogs, cats, birds, fish and other usual household pets that spend their primary existence within the mobile home. Management may restrict the breeds of particular pets allowed in the Park. See Management for a list of such restricted breeds. Except for fish and caged birds, each home may have a maximum of two (2) pets. Pet owners must sign a Pet Agreement as an addendum to their rental agreement for each pet. Residents may not board exotic animals such as, but not limited to, reptiles, rodents (other than hamsters and guinea pigs), ferrets, hedgehogs, skunks, rats, raccoons, squirrels, potbellied pigs, monkeys, arachnids, or any farm animal.

11.2.sec=When outdoors, pets must be on a leash and attended by a resident. All pets must be walked on a short leash and the person walking the animal must immediately pick up any excrement from the pet. Pet feces on the homesite must be picked up daily. Pets are not permitted in the clubhouse. This exclusion does not apply to properly trained service animals. Pets are not permitted on another resident's space without that resident's permission. Pets in violation of the above rule may be taken to an Animal Control facility at the pet owner's expense, or you may be required to remove the pet from the Park.

11.3.sec=The pet owner is responsible for any damage or harm caused by the pet to Park property, resident's and guest's, and/or a resident’s or guest’s property. If a pet causes an unreasonable disturbance, annoyance, or harm, including but not limited to, barking, growling, biting, or any other unreasonable noise, harm, or damage to any person or property, permission to keep the animal may be revoked by the Park.

12.1.sec=Guests must observe all Park Rules and Regulations and must be accompanied by a resident when using Park facilities. Any guest staying more than twenty (20) consecutive days, or thirty (30) days in a calendar year, must register in the Park office and may be required to sign these Rules and Regulations or other documents reasonably necessary to protect management's interests and the interests of other residents. Regardless of whether or not a guest signs any park documents, no guest shall have any rights of tenancy in the Park. No guest, other than those qualified under <a href="http://law.onecle.com/california/civil/798.34.html">Civil Code section 798.34</a>, may stay with a resident for more than a total of twenty (20) consecutive days or thirty (30) days in a calendar year. A violation of this rule may result in legal action being taken against the resident and/or guest. If a resident wishes to add a person as a member of their household, where such person shall not thereafter be considered a "guest," the prior written consent of management must be obtained. The subject person must submit an application for occupancy and sign the Park Rules and Regulations and other required documents, but not a rental agreement, management may also require any such person to sign an additional occupant/long term guest agreement. In the future, if all of the residents who signed the rental agreement move from the Park, the remaining occupant will be treated as a new applicant for residency. The remaining adult will, however, be required to provide evidence of ownership via HCD title transfer.

12.2.sec=Management may refuse any guest access to the facilities if that guest's presence would reasonably detract from the use and enjoyment of the facilities by other residents and guests.

12.4.sec=A guest who remains in the Park after his host has died, moved, or for any other reason does not physically reside in the Park on a regular basis, will be considered to be the equivalent of a potential purchaser and the guest will be subject to the requirements of new tenancy approval (See <a href="http://law.onecle.com/california/civil/798.74.html">California Civil Code section 798.74</a>) and must apply for and be approved for tenancy, whether or not the guest has an ownership or financial interest or lien in or to the manufactured home, such as a “legal” or “registered” owner of record. The requirements of this agreement will also apply if homeowner only sells/transfers a portion of the in the manufactured home or assigns only a portion of the right to occupy the homesite.

The Park does not provide supervision of any person or at any facility and is not responsible for damage, loss, or injury to residents or other users of the facilities, and will not be responsible for any personal items left at or taken from the facilities at any time.

Permission to use the facilities must be requested by a registered resident on a form provided by Management (available in the Park office) at least one week in advance. A refundable deposit may be required and will be applied to the cost of any additional clean up or damages that may be necessary. However, should the clubhouse be used for an event that includes all Park residents, then no deposit is required. The resident(s) will be responsible for the cost of any clean up, damages or repair exceeding the deposit.

Any such rights granted us due to amendments, deletions, or modifications of the Mobilehome Residency Law and other applicable law may be enforced by management at management’s sole discretion.

15.Ti=RENT:

15.sec=Rents are due and payable on the first day of each month. Utility charges or any and all other service charges are also due with rent.  Resident agrees to pay a late charge of $35.00 if rent and other charges, if any, are not received by the Park on or before the fifth (5) day after those charges are due. Resident and Management agree that Management will sustain damage on account of any late payment of rent, including but not limited to added accounting, administrative, and management expenses and costs, but that it will be impracticable and extremely difficult to specify the actual amount of such damage. The parties agree that this late charge represents a fair and reasonable estimate of the damages that Management will incur by reason of the late payment of rent. Resident bears the risk of loss or delay of any payment made by mail. A return check charge may be assessed by the Park in the amount of thirty-five dollars ($35.00) whenever a check for rent or any other charges is returned unpaid from a bank or financial institution.
