1.sec={_National_Privacy_Law}s in certain jurisdictions may require the obligations in {Annex.ControllerControllerAgreement.Xref}, {Annex.ControllerProcessorAgreement.Xnum} and {Annex.BasicControllerProcessorAgreement.Xnum} to be supplemented by additional or alternative provisions to ensure an adequate level of protection in respect of {_Relevant_Transfer}s originating from those jurisdictions ("{DefT.Special_Term}s"). The provisions in {Annex.ControllerControllerAgreement.Xref}, {Annex.ControllerProcessorAgreement.Xnum} and {Annex.BasicControllerProcessorAgreement.Xnum} shall be interpreted in accordance with any {_Special_Term}s identified in {Annex.JurisdictionSpecific.Xref}, as applicable to {_Relevant_Transfer}s originating from a jurisdiction specified in that schedule. 

2.sec=In the case of {_Onward_Transfer}s the {_Data_Importer} receiving the {_Personal_Data} upon the {_Onward_Transfer} shall observe the same obligations as those imposed on a {_Data_Importer} under the original {_Relevant_Transfer}.

3.sec=The {_Parties} undertake not to vary or modify the provisions set out in {Annex.ControllerControllerAgreement.Xref}, {Annex.ControllerProcessorAgreement.Xnum} or {Annex.BasicControllerProcessorAgreement.Xnum} where applicable, of this {_Agreement}. This restriction does not preclude the {_parties} from amending other parts of this {_Agreement} or adding provisions on business related issues where required as long as they do not contradict the provisions in {Annex.ControllerControllerAgreement.Xref}, {Annex.ControllerProcessorAgreement.Xnum} or {Annex.BasicControllerProcessorAgreement.Xnum} ("{_Permitted_Variation}"). 

4.sec=The {_Lead_Entity} may propose a {_Permitted_Variation} to this {_Agreement} by providing details of the proposed {_Permitted_Variation} in a notice to the other {_P1_Affiliate}s. If, within thirty (30) days of receipt of that notice, a {_party} notifies the {_Lead_Entity} in writing of any objections (on reasonable grounds) to the proposed {_Permitted_Variation}, the {_Lead_Entity} shall work with the {_party} in good faith to agree the {_Permitted_Variation} and provide details of any amendments to the proposed {_Permitted_Variation} to other {_P1_Affiliate}s. The {_parties} shall be deemed to have agreed to the proposed change if they do not notify the {_Lead_Entity} within the period of thirty (30) business days of the date of the notice, or such other period as may be specified by the {_Lead_Entity} in its notice to other {_P1_Affiliate}s. If no comments or objections are made, the {_Lead_Entity} may execute the {_Permitted_Variation} as attorney on behalf of the {_Parties}, in accordance with the power of attorney granted by clause {PowerOfAttorney.ToLeadEntity.Xnum}. The {_Permitted_Variation} will take effect when executed by the {_Lead_Entity}.
