Ti=Article 34 - Communication of a {_personal_data_breach} to the {_data_subject}

1.sec=When the {_personal_data_breach} is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of {_natural_persons}, the {_controller} shall communicate the {_personal_data_breach} to the {_data_subject} without undue delay.

2.sec=The communication to the {_data_subject} referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall describe in clear and plain language the nature of the {_personal_data_breach} and contain at least the information and the recommendations provided for in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 33(3).

3.0.sec=The communication to the {_data_subject} referred to in paragraph 1 shall not be required if any of the following conditions are met:

3.1.sec=the {_controller} has implemented appropriate technical and organisational protection measures, and that those measures were applied to the {_personal_data} affected by the {_personal_data_breach}, in particular those that render the {_personal_data} unintelligible to any person who is not authorised to access it, such as encryption;

3.2.sec=the {_controller} has taken subsequent measures which ensure that the high risk to the rights and freedoms of {_data_subjects} referred to in paragraph 1 is no longer likely to materialise;

3.3.sec=it would involve disproportionate effort. In such a case, there shall instead be a public communication or similar measure whereby the {_data_subjects} are informed in an equally effective manner.

3.=[G/Z/ol-a/s3]

4.sec=If the {_controller} has not already communicated the {_personal_data_breach} to the {_data_subject}, the {_supervisory_authority}, having considered the likelihood of the {_personal_data_breach} resulting in a high risk, may require it to do so or may decide that any of the conditions referred to in paragraph 3 are met.
