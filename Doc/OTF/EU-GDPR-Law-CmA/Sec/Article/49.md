1.7.1.sec=the transfer is made from a register which according to Union or Member State law is intended to provide information to the public and which is open to consultation either by the public in general or by any person who can demonstrate a legitimate interest, but only to the extent that the conditions laid down in Union or Member State law for consultation are fulfilled in the particular case.

1.7.2.sec=Where a transfer could not be based on a provision in Articles 45 or 46, including the provisions on {_binding_corporate_rules}, and none of the derogations for a specific situation pursuant to points (a) to (g) of this paragraph is applicable, a transfer to a third country or an {_international_organisation} may take place only if the transfer is not repetitive, concerns only a limited number of {_data_subjects}, is necessary for the purposes of compelling legitimate interests pursued by the {_controller} which are not overridden by the interests or rights and freedoms of the {_data_subject}, and the {_controller} has assessed all the circumstances surrounding the data transfer and has on the basis of that assessment provided suitable safeguards with regard to the protection of {_personal_data}. The {_controller} shall inform the {_supervisory_authority} of the transfer.
