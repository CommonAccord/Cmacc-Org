The basic framework for contract agreements, perhaps usable for all left-to-right alphabetic languages.  Extended into English.<br>

Derived from Agt-Form-CmA, with only the /EN/ form presented here. <br>

The idea is to use this as a base for all contract agreements.  It becomes both a "style guide" and a taxonomy of such basic concepts as parties and contract sections.  That improves human reading because of the standard form, promotes standards-formation and greatly facilitates machine reading. <br>
