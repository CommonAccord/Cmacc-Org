Note=From a SaaS licence model created for Y-Combinator [G/YCombinator-SaaS-CmA/].  A SaaS (Software as a Service) agreement is obviously not directly a data sharing agreement.  But it overlaps substantially, and this form is presented with substantial structure.  The "agreement" references general terms, and the general terms here are organized into three major headings that begin with the most business-oriented, to the more structural and then the most legal.
