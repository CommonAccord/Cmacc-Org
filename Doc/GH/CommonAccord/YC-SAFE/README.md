# YC-SAFE
for the YCombinator "SAFE" Notes - http://www.ycombinator.com/documents/#safe (no endorsement)

This repo has prose objects for the YC SAFE Notes.  (It is not endorsed (yet?) by YC - our own work.)  

See 
https://github.com/CommonAccord/Form-Agt/blob/master/README.md for more intro to  prose objects.

Happy if someone with more knowledge than ours would pick up this project and perfect it.  Flatter us with forks.

The four forms of the Notes are built by referencing the Cap Discount prose object.  See list.html for more discussion. 

The four Note variations each using the same term sheet can be seen in a demo at http://source.commonaccord.org/index.php?action=list&file=F/Demo/Note_YC/.
