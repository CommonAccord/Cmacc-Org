1.Ti=Scope

1.1.sec=This Trust Framework defines the business, legal and technology Rules governing Participation in the ID Federation. The ID Federation is intended to provide federation of identities as described in this Trust Framework by and between Participants who have Existing Commercial Relationships by which they are involved in the provision of, sale, distribution, licensing, or use of a financial or insurancerelated product or service. This Trust Framework is not intended to create commercial relationships between Parties with no other relationship, but rather is intended to improve security, enhance ease of use, and replace passwords with federated identities by and between Parties with existing trusted relationships within the financial services and insurance industry. This Trust Framework applies to Parties that have executed the Participation Agreement and thereby have agreed to the terms and conditions of this Trust Framework. The authoritative and current version of this Trust Framework is the document available at the ID Federation website (currently signononce.Org.). This Trust Framework incorporates by reference Formal Policies and Official Documents which are available from the ID Federation website.

1.2.sec=Parties may also have a capacity within the ID Federation. One simple example is that an insurance carrier may be a Member of the ID Federation and, in that capacity, the insurance carrier could vote on Rule changes. At the same time, that Party may also be a Relying Party, and in that capacity they are subject to the Rules in this Trust Framework.

2.Ti=Roles

2.0.sec=The Roles described in Sections 1.01(b)(i)-(vi) are Participants in the ID Federation operational system. A Party may undertake more than one Role under this Trust Framework. 

2.1.Ti=Identity Provider

2.1.1.sec=An Identity Provider (IdP) is a Participant that issues Tokens to Individual Users and effectuates the passing of those Tokens to Relying Parties for purposes of asserting and Authenticating Individual User identities. An IdP is responsible for issuing a Token only to Individual Users that have been provisioned by the duly authorized and responsible User Authority for each such Individual User and for revoking the Token of each such Individual User upon their de-provisioning by their respective User Authority.  An IdP is responsible for the Existing Commercial Relationship as well as each User Authority to which it issues Individual User Credentials and Tokens and each Relying Party that accepts any such Credential and Token.

2.1.2.sec=An Identity Provider may delegate services to one or more Identity Provider Proxies as long as the Authenticating Identity Provider and all Identity Provider Proxies have a Certified Service and the Relying Party is made aware of the specific details of the Delegation in the Underlying Commercial Contract or as otherwise specified by the Participants.

2.1.3.sec=Certified Services: An IdP may have one or more active Certified Services that have been certified by an ID Federation-identified Assessor under the Trust Framework Certification Policy that is hereby incorporated by reference into this Trust Framework and is attached hereto at Appendix A.

2.2.Ti=Relying Party

2.2.1.sec=A Relying Party (RP) is a Participant that accepts and relies upon a Token of an Individual User that has been issued by an IdP, and received for the purpose of asserting and Authenticating the identity of the Individual User. The RP is responsible for determining for itself whether to accept any given Token and determining the extent to which reliance upon any Token is reasonable, and to determine whether, how or the extent to which a given Individual User may be authorized to conduct a transaction or other interaction with the RP. An RP is responsible for the Existing Commercial Relationship with each IdP issuing Tokens accepted by that RP. An RP is also responsible for the Existing Commercial Relationship with each User Authority for any Individual User whose Tokens that RP accepts.

2.2.2.sec=Certified Services: ID Federation members will not require a Certified Service to perform the role of Relying Party but an RP may have one or more active Certified Services if the RP acts as an Identity Provider.

The User Authority is responsible for requesting provisioning, managing access to, and de-provisioning the ID Credentials and Tokens of Individual Users within its business. A User Authority is responsible for the Existing Commercial Relationship with an IdP that issues a Token to any Individual User within its business. A User Authority is responsible for determining the Existing Commercial Relationship with each RP that accepts and relies upon a Token issued to any Individual User within its business.

2.4.Ti=Policy Authority
