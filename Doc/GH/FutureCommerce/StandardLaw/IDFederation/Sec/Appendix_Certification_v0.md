Identity Providers are certified by the ID Federation and are granted the right to use the ID Federation Certification Trust Mark with the word “Certified IdP” after the mark. Relying Parties are not certified, and they are granted the right to use the ID Federation Membership Trust Mark without the “Certified IdP” designation. 
(i) The Identity Provider must complete the Trust Framework Security Assessment which is then reviewed by the Assessor. The Trust Framework Security Assessment is a survey based on the ISO 27001 standards and BITS shared assessment standards that evaluate the general security posture and security controls pertaining to ID federation implementation.

The Assessor shall provide a report to the Identity Provider indicating that the Identity Provider has met the requirements for certification or including a list of the issues that must be resolved in order to meet the requirements for certification. If the Identity Provider has met the requirements for certification, the Identity Provider may direct the Assessor to provide the report to the ID Federation Board of Directors. If the Identity Provider has not met the requirements for certification, the Identity Provider shall have the opportunity to resolve any issues within a one (1) year period following receipt of the report. In such event, additional fees may be required by the Assessor to complete certification.
7. Certification Decision
The ID Federation Board of Directors shall review and evaluate the Assessment Report and any other relevant information in making the final decision on certification of a service. The Board of Directors may include stipulations in its granting of certifications. This Certification Policy may be revised from time to time by the ID Federation Board of Directors. The Participant must review the ID Federation website or other means designated or approved by the Policy Authority from time to time for updates to the certification policy.
