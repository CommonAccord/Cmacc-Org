Title.=[Z/f/paras/s3]

0.Ti=Mission Statement

0.sec=Our mission is promoting information security and identity management for trusted transactions across the financial services and insurance industries for purposes including but not limited to reducing transaction friction, lowering cost and bolstering independent agent access.

1.Ti=Article 1: Business

1.1.Ti=TO BE DETERMINED (ORIGINAL HAS NONE)

1.1.1.Ti=1.01(a) Scope

1.1.1.1.sec=This Trust Framework defines the business, legal and technology Rules governing Participation in the ID Federation. The ID Federation is intended to provide federation of identities as described in this Trust Framework by and between Participants who have Existing Commercial Relationships by which they are involved in the provision of, sale, distribution, licensing, or use of a financial or insurancerelated product or service. This Trust Framework is not intended to create commercial relationships between Parties with no other relationship, but rather is intended to improve security, enhance ease of use, and replace passwords with federated identities by and between Parties with existing trusted relationships within the financial services and insurance industry. This Trust Framework applies to Parties that have executed the Participation Agreement and thereby have agreed to the terms and conditions of this Trust Framework. The authoritative and current version of this Trust Framework is the document available at the ID Federation website (currently signononce.Org.). This Trust Framework incorporates by reference Formal Policies and Official Documents which are available from the ID Federation website.

1.1.1.2.sec=Parties may also have a capacity within the ID Federation. One simple example is that an insurance carrier may be a Member of the ID Federation and, in that capacity, the insurance carrier could vote on Rule changes. At the same time, that Party may also be a Relying Party, and in that capacity they are subject to the Rules in this Trust Framework.

1.1.1.=[Z/f/ol/s2]

1.1.2.Ti=1.01(b) Roles

1.1.2.0.sec=The Roles described in Sections 1.01(b)(i)-(vi) are Participants in the ID Federation operational system. A Party may undertake more than one Role under this Trust Framework. 

1.1.2.1.Ti=1.01(b)(i) Identity Provider

1.1.2.1.1.Ti=An Identity Provider (IdP) is a Participant that issues Tokens to Individual Users and effectuates the passing of those Tokens to Relying Parties for purposes of asserting and Authenticating Individual User identities. An IdP is responsible for issuing a Token only to Individual Users that have been provisioned by the duly authorized and responsible User Authority for each such Individual User and for revoking the Token of each such Individual User upon their de-provisioning by their respective User Authority.  An IdP is responsible for the Existing Commercial Relationship as well as each User Authority to which it issues Individual User Credentials and Tokens and each Relying Party that accepts any such Credential and Token.

1.1.2.1.2.sec=An Identity Provider may delegate services to one or more Identity Provider Proxies as long as the Authenticating Identity Provider and all Identity Provider Proxies have a Certified Service and the Relying Party is made aware of the specific details of the Delegation in the Underlying Commercial Contract or as otherwise specified by the Participants.

1.1.2.1.3.sec=Certified Services: An IdP may have one or more active Certified Services that have been certified by an ID Federation-identified Assessor under the Trust Framework Certification Policy that is hereby incorporated by reference into this Trust Framework and is attached hereto at Appendix A.

1.1.2.1.=[Z/f/ol/s3]

1.1.2.2.Ti=1.01(b)(ii) Relying Party

1.1.2.2.1.sec=A Relying Party (RP) is a Participant that accepts and relies upon a Token of an Individual User that has been issued by an IdP, and received for the purpose of asserting and Authenticating the identity of the Individual User. The RP is responsible for determining for itself whether to accept any given Token and determining the extent to which reliance upon any Token is reasonable, and to determine whether, how or the extent to which a given Individual User may be authorized to conduct a transaction or other interaction with the RP. An RP is responsible for the Existing Commercial Relationship with each IdP issuing Tokens accepted by that RP. An RP is also responsible for the Existing Commercial Relationship with each User Authority for any Individual User whose Tokens that RP accepts.

1.1.2.2.2.sec=Certified Services: ID Federation members will not require a Certified Service to perform the role of Relying Party but an RP may have one or more active Certified Services if the RP acts as an Identity Provider.

1.1.2.2.=[Z/f/ol/s2]

1.1.2.3.Ti=1.01(b)(iii) User Authority

1.1.2.3.sec=A User Authority (UA) is a Participant with authority and responsibility to identify, enumerate and manage the Individual Users within its business. Individual Users within a User Authority’s business may include employees, contractors and others. The User Authority is responsible for requesting provisioning, managing access to, and de-provisioning the ID Credentials and Tokens of Individual Users within its business. A User Authority is responsible for the Existing Commercial Relationship with an IdP that issues a Token to any Individual User within its business. A User Authority is responsible for determining the Existing Commercial Relationship with each RP that accepts and relies upon a Token issued to any Individual User within its business.

1.1.2.4.Ti=1.01(b)(iv) Policy Authority

1.1.2.4.sec=The Board of Directors, sometimes referred to herein as the Policy Authority (PA), promulgates this Trust Framework and is responsible for amending the Trust Framework, as well as for the strategic, organic and other material decision-making activities operating under the Trust Framework, including approval of the requirements for Certified Services.

1.1.2.5.Ti=1.01(b)(v) Federation Operator

1.1.2.5.sec=The Federation Operator is responsible for day-to-day-operations of the ID Federation, including the provision of business services such as “first-point-of-contact” telephone and email communications for the ID Federation, the Onboarding of new Participants, and maintaining current records in the Participant Directory including the Metadata repository.

1.1.2.6.Ti=1.01(b)(vi) Assessor

1.1.2.6.sec=An Assessor is a third party who is responsible for certifying the service of an applicant based on a neutral and independent assessment and testing as determined by the Policy Authority from time to time.

Final Trust Framework 20140429 web
Article 3: Technical
3.01 Use Cases
3.01(a) Technical Scope
The technical scope is defined by the Use Cases that are contained in the Appendices to this Trust Framework and application of the standards, specifications and configurations described in this Article 3. Unless otherwise noted, the provisions within Article 3 apply to Parties acting in the Role of an IdP and/or an RP.
3.01(b) Technology and Use Case Change Management
Use Cases may be active or pending. The process for proposing a Use Case, and establishing when a Use Case is actively supported within the then current scope of the ID Federation or when it is agreed to become actively supported pending a future sunrise date is specified in the Trust Framework Amendment and Change Management Policy. Use Cases that are active and pending are included within the Trust Framework, with their respective status so noted, including any applicable sunrise dates.
3.01(c) Technical Use Cases
The active and pending Use Cases are fully detailed in the ID Federation Use Cases Specification, which is hereby incorporated by reference into this Trust Framework and are attached hereto at Appendix G.
3.02 Standards Conformance (IdP & RP)
IdPs and RPs must conform to at least one of the following standards. (Links regarding these standards may be found on the ID Federation website.)
3.02(a) Standards
The identity standards used by ID Federation Participants are Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) and WS-Federation.
3.02(a)(i) Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)
SAML is an XML-based open standard for exchanging Authentication and Authorization data between an IdP and an RP.
3.02(a)(ii) WS-Federation
WS-Federation is an identity federation specification, developed by BEA Systems, BMC Software, CA Inc., IBM, Layer 7 Technologies, Microsoft, Novell, Ping Identity, and VeriSign. Part of the larger Web Services Security framework, WS-Federation defines mechanisms for allowing disparate security realms to broker information on identities, Identity Attributes and Authentication.
3.02(b) Profiles
A profile defines a set of rules and constraints for a standard in order to facilitate the usage of that standard for common Use Cases. The high-level Use Cases in Section 3.01(c) are supported by the following common profiles.
Trust Framework | Trust Federation 04/30/14

3.02(b)(i) SAML
Web Browser SSO Profile
3.02(b)(ii) WS-Federation
WS-Federation Passive Requester Profile, WS-Federation Active Requester Profile
3.02(c) Attributes
Participation enables identity attribute sharing across Participant security domains to facilitate access to resources. Participants in the IdP Role are expected to provide authoritative and accurate attribute assertions to other Participants. Attributes are mutually agreed upon between each IdP and RP pair. ID Federation does not require specific attribute values, but it does require at least one attribute that is a unique identifier for the user responsible for a given transaction and at least one attribute that is a unique identifier for the organization or entity responsible for a given transaction. Relying Parties receiving attribute assertions from IdPs may choose to ignore those assertions not required to provide access.
3.02(c)(i) Recommended Unique Identifier Attributes
Email Address: If used, the email address must be valid. This is a globally unique value and is typically linked to other security controls outside of the Trust Framework, for example:
first.last@somedomain.com.
Organization Identifier: The Federation Operator maintains a list of all Participants in the Participant Directory.
3.02(c)(ii) Optional Attributes
Optional attributes are allowed and must be mutually agreed upon between Participants. Examples of optional attributes are:
Given Name;
Surname;
Organization Name – this is the name of the Participating organization a person is affiliated with as mutually agreed upon between IdP and RP;
Any additional attributes which are deemed relevant between the two federating parties
3.02(c)(iii) Attribute Uniqueness
Attributes are required to be assigned names in the form of a URL. This is to ensure uniqueness. For example: Attribute Name identifies an attribute called ‘name’ qualified by a namespace in the form of a URL. This is a predefined attribute type defined by Microsoft. If Participants require a ‘name’ attribute with different semantics, something like this could be used: Attribute Name. See the appropriate standards for SAML and WS-Federation attribute naming requirements.
3.03 Technology Requirements for IdPs and RPs
Pre-requisites for Participation by an IdP or RP in the ID Federation:
IdPs must be able to generate digitally signed SAML/WS-federation Tokens;
RPs must be able to consume digitally signed SAML/WS-Federation Tokens;
A PKI based certificate from a trusted third Certificate Authority;
Trust Framework | Trust Federation 04/30/14
12
Final Trust Framework 20140429 web
Ability to create a connection end point;
Consume Metadata from federation partner including information on the federation end-point;
Establish secure transport layer to communicate (SSL/HTTPS);
Any additional attributes beyond what is specified in Section 3.02(c)(i) and (ii) are considered custom attributes and must be agreed upon between IdP and RP
3.03(a) Establishing Initial ID Federation Relationship Between IdPs and RPs
Once the pre-requisites are met, an IdP and an RP exchange Metadata to configure their respective technology products to participate in the federation.
3.03(a)(i) Metadata Exchange
After legal and business agreements are established, Participants in the ID Federation can exchange Metadata. Metadata can be exchanged dynamic via a link or out of band.
3.03(a)(ii) Time Synchronization
All Participants must implement an agreed upon level of time synchronization on all infrastructure providing IdP or RP services. Time synchronization is required to ensure that timeouts and expirations can be applied correctly across multiple systems and eliminate the risk of time drift generating connectivity issues. Clock synchronization is critical for ID Federation to be successful. It is recommended that partners participating in federation use a standard time sync tool, such as NTP pool or any central service the federation partners are signed up with. It is recommended the degree of tolerance should not exceed Stratum 3.
3.04 Security Requirements (IdP & RP)
This section includes the security requirements applicable to the ID Federation.
3.04(a) User IDs and Passwords
All Participants of the Trust Framework that will act as an IdP will adhere to the standard requirements for the implementation and administration of User IDs and passwords. The requirements were selected to meet regulatory and compliance guidelines as well as Information Security best practices. In addition, any entity providing a service or storing data on behalf of the Trust Framework must adhere to the requirements. A Participant may implement stricter security measures but is required to meet or exceed the requirements defined below to participate as a Trusted Partner. The following section is based upon NIST recommendations and California DMV standards.
3.04(a)(i) User ID
User ID naming convention (applies to Trust Framework entity only)
Access privilege removal for inactive, suspended, and terminated User IDs by the vendor
An IdP must have a process to ensure credentials will never be sent to an RP where the User’s ID is suspended, terminated, or revoked by the vendor
3.04(a)(ii) Password
Password protected at rest
Hashed using SHA-256 or higher;
Encrypted with AES algorithm with minimum 128-bit key
Passwords protected in motion (one of the following)
Hash or encrypt the password (using a seed to prevent replay), using algorithm/keylength requirements the same as passwords at rest;
Encrypt the channel using either SSL V3.0 or TLS V1.0 (or higher)
Password strength standards
Must be seven (7) or more characters in length;
Must contain at least three of the following:
Uppercase letter;
Lower case letter;
Number;
Special character
Password Expiration
Password must expire every sixty (60) days
Lock out after failed Authentication attempts
Account must lock after five (5) invalid login attempts;
No automated unlock permitted;
A standard process must be in place to manage password resets executed by
a system administrator or delegated administrator
Password Reset and Changes
A user must provide their current password or answer a preselected security
question to change or reset their password;
A standard process must be in place to manage password resets executed by
a system administrator or delegated administrator
Password Reuse
A password history must be maintained and none of the previous twelve (12)
passwords may be selected for reuse;
A new password may not be changed again for forty-eight (48) hours in
prevention of password recycling
3.04(b) Certificate
One of the primary tools aimed at ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability will be the utilization of a Public Key Infrastructure. This approach requires a pre-existing relationship between Participants and the utilization of digital signatures from a reputable Certificate Authority. It is at the discretion of each Participant whether to accept digital certificates from an individual Certificate Authority.
3.04(b)(i) Certificate Authority
While the ID Federation does not endorse any particular Certificate Authorities, a list of common Certificate Authorities may be available on the ID Federation website from time to time. Acceptable Certificate Authorities must be agreed to by the integrating Participants for each implementation.
3.04(b)(ii) Certificate Expiration
Certificate will be issued for no longer than one (1) year.
3.04(b)(iii) Certificate Management
Each organization must obtain its own certificates. Certificates are validated on use to meet date, name, issuer and revocation requirements.
3.04(c) Delegation
Delegation by Identity Provider Proxies is permitted in the Trust Framework to the restrictions set forth in Section 1.01(b)(1).
3.04(d) Logging and Monitoring
All IdPs and RPs are required to deploy appropriate logging mechanisms for the purpose of providing audit, traceability, troubleshooting and threat identification of identity-related activities, including but not limited to the success or failure of Authentication events.
All IdPs and RPs are required to deploy appropriate log monitoring and alerting mechanisms for the purpose of identifying and responding to potential threats and attacks. The term of retention for logging shall be agreed upon between IdP and RP.
3.04(e) General Enterprise Security Controls
Creating a secure environment is foundational to business relationships and is not limited to federated transactions. The requirements within Section 3.04 above speak to those which are directly related to federation. Numerous other security measures will be taken into consideration with any implementation between two external entities, including without limitation the following:

Trust Framework Certification Policy 1
Appendix A
Certification Policy
Defined terms used in this document will have the meanings provided in this document or in the Trust Framework Glossary.
1. Introduction
This policy describes the processes and rules governing certification by the ID Federation of Certified Services provided by Identity Providers.1
2. General Meaning of Certified Services
Certification means that the Assessor has established that the Participant’s service has met the Security Requirements by one of the methods described in Section 5 of this document. In order to have a Certified Service, the following conditions must be met:
(i) The entity seeking certification represents that it is complying with the Technical Requirements and the Security Requirements set forth in the Trust Framework;
(ii) The entity is a Member in good standing of the ID Federation; and
(iii) The certification has been approved by the Board of Directors.
3. Certification Process
An Identity Provider may have one or more Certified Services. Certification shall be conducted by an Assessor. The Identity Provider and the Assessor shall enter into a Certification Agreement containing specific terms and conditions for certification and the applicable fee for certification.
4. Requirements for Certification
The Identity Provider seeking certification for a service must meet the following requirements at the time of application:
(i) The Identity Provider must have signed a Participation Agreement that has been accepted by the ID Federation; and
(ii) The Identity Provider must be a member in good standing.
5. Methods for Certification
An entity seeking certification of a service may utilize one of the three methods described below to establish that the certifying service adheres to the security requirements defined in the Trust Framework:

1
Identity Providers are certified by the ID Federation and are granted the right to use the ID Federation Certification Trust Mark with the word “Certified IdP” after the mark. Relying Parties are not certified, and they are granted the right to use the ID Federation Membership Trust Mark without the “Certified IdP” designation. 
(i) The Identity Provider must complete the Trust Framework Security Assessment which is then reviewed by the Assessor. The Trust Framework Security Assessment is a survey based on the ISO 27001 standards and BITS shared assessment standards that evaluate the general security posture and security controls pertaining to ID federation implementation.
(ii) The Identity Provider must provide an ISO 27001 Certification specific to the processing location for the service.
(iii) The Identity Provider must provide a SOC 2 Type 2 Report specific to the processing location for the service that covers confidentiality, integrity, availability, and security.
6. Assessment Report
The Assessor shall provide a report to the Identity Provider indicating that the Identity Provider has met the requirements for certification or including a list of the issues that must be resolved in order to meet the requirements for certification. If the Identity Provider has met the requirements for certification, the Identity Provider may direct the Assessor to provide the report to the ID Federation Board of Directors. If the Identity Provider has not met the requirements for certification, the Identity Provider shall have the opportunity to resolve any issues within a one (1) year period following receipt of the report. In such event, additional fees may be required by the Assessor to complete certification.
7. Certification Decision
The ID Federation Board of Directors shall review and evaluate the Assessment Report and any other relevant information in making the final decision on certification of a service. The Board of Directors may include stipulations in its granting of certifications. This Certification Policy may be revised from time to time by the ID Federation Board of Directors. The Participant must review the ID Federation website or other means designated or approved by the Policy Authority from time to time for updates to the certification policy.
Appendix B
ID Federation Trust Mark Policy
1.0 Certification Trust Mark
The Certification Trust Mark, for use by authorized Participants, is intended to certify that the Participant has met specified standards allowing the Participant's participation in a trusted network of digital communications.
1.1 Certification Trust Mark Restrictions
In addition to the General Trust Mark restrictions identified in Section 3.0 below, the following restrictions apply to the use of the Certification Trust Mark:
1.1(a) The Certification Trust Mark may only be used to identify Certified Services.
1.1(b) Participants may not represent any service as being certified, conformant, or compliant, or use those terms in connection with any advertising unless and until the service is a Certified Service.
1.1(c) Use of the Certification Trust Mark is permitted only for so long as the Certified Service continues to comply with the standards under which certification was granted (as may be amended from time to time). In the event a Participant is terminated or suspended, all use of the Trust Mark must immediately cease and be removed from existing materials and online content until and unless the Participant is restored to active status.
2.0 Membership Trust Mark
The Membership Trust Mark, for use by Members and Participants, is intended to identify a Party’s participation or membership in the ID Federation.
2.1 Membership Trust Mark Restrictions
In addition to the General Trust Mark restrictions identified in Section 3.0 below, the following restrictions apply to the use of the Membership Trust Mark:
2.1(a) The Membership Trust Mark may only be used by current Participants and
Members.
2.1(b) Use of the Membership Trust Mark is permitted only for so long as the Participant or Member continues to remain as a Participant or Member in good standing of the ID Federation. In the event a Participant is terminated or suspended, all use of the Trust Mark must immediately cease and be removed from existing materials and online content until and unless the Participant is restored to active status.
3.0 General Trust Mark Guidelines
All Trust Mark reproductions must be made pursuant to the general restrictions on use and appearance (height, spacing, and color). Refer to the Logo Style Guide on the ID Federation website. 
Appendix C
Antitrust Policy
Those participating in ID Federation activities of any type should be aware of the need to exercise caution to avoid inadvertent violations of EU, international, national or state/province antitrust and anticompetitive laws. Violations of such laws can result in severe civil penalties (and in some jurisdictions, criminal penalties) for individuals as well as their employers.
Laws relating to antitrust and anticompetitive behavior can be quite complex, and differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Consequently, it is not possible to summarize them in this policy, and you should therefore consult appropriate advisors at your own company for detailed guidance.
The following rules shall apply in connection with all ID Federation meetings, activities, and other forms of participation:
1. Agendas must be created, and minutes must be taken, for all ID Federation meetings. These agendas and minutes must then be submitted to ID Federation, along with any meeting materials, to document the topics discussed and any agreements reached.
2. Certain topics should never be discussed at, or in connection with, any ID Federation meeting or other ID Federation activity, nor should you ever form an agreement with any other ID Federation Member or any one else in connection with these topics. In particular, DO NOT at any time discuss, or agree upon:
 Your current or future prices, or any strategies relating to pricing
 Any increase or decrease in prices, or other terms (e.g., discounts) relating to prices
 Your market shares or those of others
 Levels of investment or development, or changes to such levels
 Your current or future design or marketing strategies.
 How much or little you are capable of producing or will sell of any product or service
 Whether you have submitted a bid, or will or will not bid, in any given situation
 Where each of you will or will not sell any product or service
 Whether you will or will not deal with any third party
3. Do not disclose or discuss at or in connection with any ID Federation meeting or activity any terms upon which you will make any of your intellectual property rights available, except to the extent permitted or required under the ID Federation IPR Policy.
If at any time you become aware of any activity that may be in violation of any of the above rules, please bring them promptly to the attention of an ID Federation representative.
REMEMBER: All ID Federation activities must serve to promote, rather than restrict, competition to the benefit of consumers and the marketplace. Activities that do otherwise, or even appear to have the potential to do otherwise, may have serious consequences.
