The attached schedule spreadsheet provides a method for calculating such return.  A "Sale" of the Maker shall mean (i) any merger or consolidation to which the Maker is a party (except any merger or consolidation in which the holders of capital stock of the Maker immediately prior to such merger or consolidation continue to hold, immediately following such merger or consolidation and in approximately the same relative proportions as they held voting stock of the Maker, at least 51% of the ordinary voting power of the capital stock of (A) the surviving or resulting corporation or (B) if the surviving or resulting corporation is a wholly-owned subsidiary of another corporation immediately following such merger or consolidation, of the parent corporation of such surviving or resulting corporation), (ii) the sale by the stockholders of the Maker, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, of capital stock representing at least 80% of the outstanding ordinary voting power of the Maker, or (iii) the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Maker.
