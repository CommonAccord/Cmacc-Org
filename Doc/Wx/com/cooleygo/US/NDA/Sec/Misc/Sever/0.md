Ti=Interpretation to Make Valid

sec=If any provision of {_this_Agreement} is found by a proper authority to be unenforceable or invalid, such unenforceability or invalidity will not render {_this_Agreement} unenforceable or invalid as a whole and, in such event, such provision will be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such unenforceable or invalid provision within the limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions.
