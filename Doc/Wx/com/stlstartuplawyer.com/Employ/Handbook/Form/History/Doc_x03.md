=Harassment Prohibition

={Company Name} prohibits harassment based on race, color, sex, {sexual orientation}, age, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, mental or physical disability, and veteran status. The Company will not tolerate any conduct which constitutes harassment of any employee or any individual working at or conducting business with the Company by any person, including co-workers, supervisors, customers, or any non-employee working at or conducting business with the Company.

=Harassment includes verbal, physical or visual conduct based on race, color, sex, age, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, mental or physical disability, or veteran status that creates an intimidating, offensive, or hostile work environment or that unreasonably interferes with job performance.  Harassment may also include unwelcome, offensive slurs, jokes or other similar conduct.  Sexual harassment also includes any request or demand for sexual favors that is implicitly or expressly a condition of employment, continued employment, or considered in employment decisions such as promotion, performance evaluations, pay adjustments, discipline, work assignments, etc.

=Complaint Procedure

=A.	Reporting Violations.  Employees are encouraged to report any incident of harassment by any {Company Name} employee or any other person.  Employees should report incidents promptly to their supervisor or to {title/position} to ensure proper handling. If an employee is uncomfortable reporting an incident to the designated individuals for any reason, they should report the incident to {alternate title/position}. Supervisors who receive complaints, observe or become aware of possible harassment must immediately report the matter to the {title/position} to ensure proper handling. Failure to do so may result in discipline, up to and including discharge.

=B.	Investigating Complaints.  Every complaint or report of harassment will be investigated thoroughly and promptly.  For any complaint where the Company deems it appropriate, an investigator who is not an employee of the Company may conduct the investigation. Although absolute confidentiality cannot be guaranteed, all complaints will be handled as confidentially as possible and only those persons with a need to know will be informed of the investigation findings. The investigation findings will be documented. The complaining  employee will be kept advised of the progress of the investigation and of the investigator’s findings and conclusions.

=C.	Discipline.  If the investigation determines that harassment by a {Company Name} employee occurred, the Company will take appropriate remedial action for the circumstances, which may involve discipline.  Disciplinary action for a violation of this policy can range from a written warning up to and including discharge, depending upon the circumstances. With regard to acts of harassment by non-employees, remedial action within the ability of the Company will be taken.

=D.	Retaliation Prohibited. The Company will not tolerate any form of retaliation against any employee for making a complaint about harassment, reporting a possible incident of harassment or cooperating in the investigation of a complaint.  Employees who make complaints in bad faith or who fail to provide truthful or complete information in the course of a complaint or investigation are subject to discipline.

=Duties of Employees and Supervisors

For this reason, it is important that you report to work as scheduled. Employees who are unnecessarily and/or repeatedly tardy or absent will be disciplined, up to and including discharge.

=Absence

=There are times when absence is unavoidable.  If you need to be absent from work for whatever reason, you should notify your supervisor by the beginning of your shift.  Failure to so notify the supervisor, except under the most extenuating circumstances, will result in disciplinary action.  If you need to leave the worksite during your shift, you must first obtain permission from your immediate Supervisor.
