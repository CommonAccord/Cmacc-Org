={Include Applicable Categories}

1.7.1.sec=Full-time Regular Employees -- Employees hired to work a workweek of {forty (40)} hours or more on a regular basis. Your position may require a regular schedule of more than {40} hours a week. Full-time regular employees may be "exempt" or "nonexempt" as defined below. These employees will be eligible for benefits (such as {medical, dental, vision, life insurance}, etc.) as well as Paid Time Off and Holiday pay.

={Note:  Less than 40 hours may be established as full-time.  Under the Affordable Care Act, 30 hours will be considered full-time; however, that provision has not been implemented at this time.  Eligibility for insurance benefits is determined by the individual benefit plans, which must be consulted in drafting the handbook benefit eligibility requirements.}

Introductory employees are evaluated at or near the end of their first 90 days of service, at which time a decision will be made to continue their service as a regular employee, to extend their introductory period, or to terminate their employment. Successful completion of the introductory period does not guarantee continued employment and does not alter an employee’s at-will employment status.

1.7.5.sec=Temporary Employees – Employees engaged to work full time or part time with the understanding that their employment will typically be terminated upon completion of a specific project or assignment.

This encourages you to use your PTO and allows the Company to manage its financial obligations responsibly.  Once you reach your cap, you will not accumulate any more PTO until you use some of the time in your account and drop below the cap.  After your balance goes below the cap, you will begin accruing PTO again.  However, you will not receive retroactive credit for time worked while you were at the cap limit. PTO accrual is capped at your Maximum Annual Accrual plus {40} hours.}

=Management of PTO

=You are responsible for managing your PTO account.  It is important that you plan ahead for how you will use it.  This means developing a plan for taking your vacations, as well as doctor’s appointments and personal business.  It also means holding some time in “reserve” for the unexpected, such as emergencies and illnesses.

=Minimum Increments of PTO

=The minimum amount of PTO you can use at one time depends on whether you are an hourly or salaried employee.  If you are an hourly employee, you may not take less than {one} hour off at a time.  If you are a salaried employee you must take PTO in increments of not less than {one-half day}.

=Notice, Scheduling and Approval

=You are required to provide your supervisor with reasonable advance notice and obtain approval prior to using PTO.  This allows for you and your supervisor to prepare for your time off and assure that all staffing needs are met. There may be occasions, such as illness, when you cannot notify your supervisor in advance. In those situations, you must inform your supervisor of your circumstances as soon as possible.

=In order to ensure continuity of business operations, supervisors may limit the number of employees to which they grant approved time off at any one time.  If more than one employee requests the same period of time off, approval is granted by {employee seniority {if the time period is over three months away}.  Approval is granted by the order the request is received if the filing periods is less than three months away}. While you are encouraged to use your PTO, requests for PTO may not exceed {10} consecutive business days.

Regardless of reason for absence, if you have PTO available, you must use it for the time you are not at work, unless specifically addressed elsewhere in this policy, or by another company policy. If you appear sick, you may be asked to go home and use your PTO for the time you are away. This is to protect the work force by preventing the spread of sickness to other employees.

=Required Documentation for Select Circumstances

=Time off must be scheduled in advance whenever possible.  Unfortunately, opportunities exist for employees to try to extend planned and approved time off by calling in sick before or after holidays, vacations, etc., as well as by calling in sick multiple days in a row. In the exceptional circumstances that you may need to take PTO for sickness either immediately prior to or immediately following approved time off or holidays, you will be required to provide some form of documentation from a health care provider indicating you were treated for illness. Additionally, if you must take more than three unplanned days off for illness, you will be required to provide some form of documentation from a health care provider indicating you were treated for illness.

=Recording Paid Time Off

=You must complete an Absence Report for all PTO time used.  We are required to track absences for illness, work related illness/injury, or the attendance of school related activities for legal compliance reasons. The amount of PTO accrued, used and available will appear on your paycheck stub.

=Lunch and Breaks

=Employees of the Company who regularly work at least six hours in a day are entitled to one (1) hour {paid/unpaid} for lunch.

=Under some circumstances, employees may take FMLA leave on an intermittent or reduced schedule basis. When leave is needed for planned medical treatment, you must make a reasonable effort to schedule treatment so as not to unduly disrupt the Company’s operations. If FMLA leave is for the birth, adoption, or foster placement of a child, use of intermittent or reduced schedule leave requires the Company’s approval.

=If you find that you must be out of work for more than three days, you should contact your {supervisor/other title} to determine if FMLA leave is appropriate or to obtain additional information on and appropriate forms for the Family Medical Leave Act.

Any paid leave must be taken in accordance with Company policies.

=•	The Company requires medical certification if you request leave due to your own serious health problem or to care for a seriously ill family member.

=•	If you are taking Family and Medical Leave under this policy you are eligible to continue coverage under the Company’s existing group health plan {Optional, if applies: , life insurance and disability plan} for the duration of the leave under the same conditions as if you had continued to work.

=•	{Optional (if Employee pays part of insurance premiums): The Company will continue to make payroll deductions to collect the your share of insurance premiums during any period of FMLA leave for which you are paid using accrued paid time off. While on unpaid FMLA leave, you must continue to make these payments, either in person or by mail. The payment must be received by the {department/position} by the date day of each month. If the payment is more than 30 days late, your insurance coverage may be canceled for the duration of the leave. The Company will provide 15 days' notification prior to any loss of coverage. If the Company maintains coverage, the Company may recover the costs incurred for paying your share of any premiums, whether or not you return to work.}

=•	Leave may be taken on a continuing or intermittent basis if medically necessary for the serious health condition of you or your family member. If leave is requested on a sporadic schedule or intermittent basis, the Company may require you to transfer temporarily to a different equivalent position to permit the Company to adjust to your alternative schedule.

=•	When the need for leave is foreseeable (such as for the birth, adoption or placement of a child, or in cases of planned medical treatment), you must notify the Company thirty (30) days in advance of the requested leave.  Notice must be given to the {specify position/name} in writing, on forms provided for this purpose.  When thirty (30) days advance notice is not practical, notice must be given as soon as possible after you learn of the need for leave.

=Upon return from approved Family and Medical Leave, the Company will normally return you to your previous position or you may be moved to an equivalent position if the previous position is no longer available; provided that the Company may exempt certain key employees from this requirement and you are not entitled to reinstatement, if your employment would have been otherwise terminated for reasons unrelated to your taking FMLA leave.

=In the event of any other family member or relative not included in the above definition of immediate family, you may, at the discretion of your supervisor, be given time off without pay to attend the funeral.
