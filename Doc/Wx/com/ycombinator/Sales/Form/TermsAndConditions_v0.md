7.Ti=Indemnity

Note=OPTIONAL: many start-up companies choose not to offer indemnity as a starting point - particularly for very low cost services. Otherwise, the formulation below is a fairly {Company}-favorable indemnity provision.

7.sec={Company} shall hold {Customer} harmless from liability to third parties resulting from infringement by the Service of any United States patent or any copyright or misappropriation of any trade secret, provided {Company} is promptly notified of any and all threats, claims and proceedings related thereto and given reasonable assistance and the opportunity to assume sole control over defense and settlement; {Company} will not be responsible for any settlement it does not approve in writing.  The foregoing obligations do not apply with respect to portions or components of the Service (i) not supplied by {Company}, (ii) made in whole or in part in accordance with {Customer} specifications, (iii) that are modified after delivery by {Company}, (iv) combined with other products, processes or materials where the alleged infringement relates to such combination, (v) where {Customer} continues allegedly infringing activity after being notified thereof or after being informed of modifications that would have avoided the alleged infringement, or (vi) where {Customer}'s use of the Service is not strictly in accordance with this Agreement.  If, due to a claim of infringement, the Services are held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be or are believed by {Company} to be infringing, {Company} may, at its option and expense (a) replace or modify the Service to be non-infringing provided that such modification or replacement contains substantially similar features and functionality, (b) obtain for {Customer} a license to continue using the Service, or (c) if neither of the foregoing is commercially practicable, terminate this Agreement and {Customer}'s rights hereunder and provide {Customer} a refund of any prepaid, unused fees for the Service.
  
8.Ti=Limitation of Liability

Note=Liability limitations are frequently heavily negotiated in larger deals. This starting point is very {Company}-favorable but may need to be scaled back with larger customers

9.=[Wx/com/ycombinator/Sales/Sec/Misc_v0.md]

Note=OPTIONAL: there are several variations on these concepts that could be used as a starting point, but start-ups should typically expect resistance from large customers on these points]

EXHIBIT B

SLA.Ti=Service Level Terms

Note=OPTIONAL: the language below is an example of a very simple short-form SLA.  These terms can range from one paragraph to several pages depending on the industry, the nature of the solution and the customer profile.

SLA.sec=The Services shall be available 99.9%, measured monthly, excluding holidays and weekends and scheduled maintenance.  If {Customer} requests maintenance during these hours, any uptime or downtime calculation will exclude periods affected by such maintenance.  Further, any downtime resulting from outages of third party connections or utilities or other reasons beyond {Company}'s control will also be excluded from any such calculation. {Customer}'s sole and exclusive remedy, and {Company}'s entire liability, in connection with Service availability shall be that for each period of downtime lasting longer than {Downtime.Period}, {Company} will credit {Customer} 5% of Service fees for each period of 30 or more consecutive minutes of downtime; provided that no more than one such credit will accrue per day.  Downtime shall begin to accrue as soon as {Customer} (with notice to {Company}) recognizes that downtime is taking place, and continues until the availability of the Services is restored.  In order to receive downtime credit, {Customer} must notify {Company} in writing within 24 hours from the time of downtime, and failure to provide such notice will forfeit the right to receive downtime credit.  Such credits may not be redeemed for cash and shall not be cumulative beyond a total of credits for one (1) week of Service Fees in any one (1) calendar month in any event.  {Company} will only apply a credit to the month in which the incident occurred.  {Company}'s blocking of data communications or other Service in accordance with its policies shall not be deemed to be a failure of {Company} to provide adequate service levels under this Agreement.
