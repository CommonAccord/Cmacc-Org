Ti=Article 7 - Conditions for {_consent}

1.sec=Where {_processing} is based on {_consent}, the {_controller} shall be able to demonstrate that the {_data_subject} has {_consent}ed to {_processing} of his or her {_personal_data}.

2.sec=If the {_data_subject}'s {_consent} is given in the context of a written declaration which also concerns other matters, the request for {_consent} shall be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. Any part of such a declaration which constitutes an infringement of this Regulation shall not be binding.

3.sec=The {_data_subject} shall have the right to withdraw his or her {_consent} at any time. The withdrawal of {_consent} shall not affect the lawfulness of {_processing} based on {_consent} before its withdrawal. Prior to giving {_consent}, the {_data_subject} shall be informed thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw {_consent} as to give it.

4.sec=When assessing whether {_consent} is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on {_consent} to the {_processing} of {_personal_data} that is not necessary for the performance of that contract.
