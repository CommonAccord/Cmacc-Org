Ti=Article 7 - Conditions for consent

1.sec=Where processing is based on consent, the {_controller} shall be able to demonstrate that the {_data_subject} has consented to processing of his or her personal data.

2.sec=If the {_data_subject}'s consent is given in the context of a written declaration which also concerns other matters, the request for consent shall be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. Any part of such a declaration which constitutes an infringement of this Regulation shall not be binding.

3.sec=The {_data_subject} shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the {_data_subject} shall be informed thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw consent as to give it.

4.sec=When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract.
