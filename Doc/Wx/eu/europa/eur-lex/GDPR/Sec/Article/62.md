2.sec=Where the {_controller} or {_processor} has establishments in several Member States or where a significant number of {_data_subjects} in more than one Member State are likely to be substantially affected by {_processing} operations, a {_supervisory_authority} of each of those Member States shall have the right to participate in joint operations. The {_supervisory_authority} which is competent pursuant to Article 56 (1) or 56(4) shall invite the {_supervisory_authority} of each of those Member States to take part in the joint operations and shall respond without delay to the request of a {_supervisory_authority} to participate.

3.sec=A {_supervisory_authority} may, in accordance with Member State law, and with the seconding {_supervisory_authority}'s authorisation, confer powers, including investigative powers on the seconding {_supervisory_authority}'s members or staff involved in joint operations or, in so far as the law of the Member State of the host {_supervisory_authority} permits, allow the seconding {_supervisory_authority}'s members or staff to exercise their investigative powers in accordance with the law of the Member State of the seconding {_supervisory_authority}.

5.sec=The Member State in whose territory the damage was caused shall make good such damage under the conditions applicable to damage caused by its own staff. The Member State of the seconding {_supervisory_authority} whose staff has caused damage to any person in the territory of another Member State shall reimburse that other Member State in full any sums it has paid to the persons entitled on their behalf.

6.sec=Without prejudice to the exercise of its rights vis-à-vis third parties and with the exception of paragraph 5, each Member State shall refrain, in the case provided for in paragraph 1, from requesting reimbursement from another Member State in relation to damage referred to in paragraph 4.

In that case, the urgent need to act under Article 66(1) shall be presumed to be met and require an opinion or an urgent binding decision from the {_Board} pursuant to Article 66(2).
