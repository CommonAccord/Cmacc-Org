Note=Many of these "use" definitions are different than similar phrases in the Definitions section.

uses.and={collects}, uses, and retains

use(n).or={collection}, creation, processing, retention, use, or disclosure

use(n).and={collection}, retention, and use

use(n2).or={collection}, use, dissemination, or maintenance

used.or={collected}, used, and disclosed

use.and={collect}, retain, and use

using.or={collecting}, creating, {processing}, retaining, using, or disclosing 

use.or=access, {collect}, create, use, {process}, maintain, or disclose


destroyed.or=destroyed, {deleted}, or de-identified

destroy.or=destroy, {delete}, or de-identify 

destroy(2).or=destroy or {delete}


Note="control" seems be be used without "means of" in circumstances where it seems to refer to "means of control".  Conversely, the word "control" is also used to refer to control by the covered entity.  This may be confusing.
