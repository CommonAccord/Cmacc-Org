Ti=RECORD KEEPING

sec=The Licensee agrees to keep accurate and correct records of the Licensed Products made, used, sold, or imported and the Licensed Processes practiced under this Agreement appropriate to determine the amount of royalties due the IC.  These records shall be retained for at least five (5) years following a given reporting period and shall be available during normal business hours for inspection, at the expense of the IC, by an accountant or other designated auditor selected by the IC for the sole purpose of verifying reports and royalty payments hereunder.  The accountant or auditor shall only disclose to the IC information relating to the accuracy of reports and royalty payments made under this Agreement.  If an inspection shows an underreporting or underpayment in excess of five percent (5%) for any twelve (12) month period, then the Licensee shall reimburse the IC for the cost of the inspection at the time the Licensee pays the unreported royalties, including any additional royalties as required by Paragraph 9.8.  All royalty payments required under this Paragraph shall be due within sixty (60) days of the date the IC provides to the Licensee notice of the payment due.
