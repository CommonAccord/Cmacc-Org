No {Third_Party} has a right to acquire any interest in the {Owned_Real_Property} or in the {Acquired_Companies}' interests in the {Leased_Real_Property}.  There is no existing or proposed plan to modify or realign any street or highway or any existing or proposed eminent domain {Proceeding} that would result in the taking of all or any part of any parcel of {Real_Property} or that would prevent or hinder the continued use of any such parcel as used by the {Acquired_Companies}.

All inventories are valued at the lower of cost or {aRep.Inventory.marknet-FILO} basis consistent with past practice used in the preparation of the {Financial_Statements}.  The reserve for obsolescence with respect to inventories{aRep.Inventory.Time} is adequate and calculated consistent with past practice.  Inventories that were purchased after {the_Interim_Balance_Sheet} Date were purchased in the {Ordinary_Course_of_Business} at a cost not exceeding market prices prevailing at the time of purchase for items of similar quality and quantity.  The quantities of each item of inventory are not excessive, but are reasonable for the continued operation of each {Acquired_Company} in the {Ordinary_Course_of_Business}.
