Ti=SCOPE

1.sec=The National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC) envisions widespread, trusted identity exchanges using federated methods that are secure, interoperable, privacy-enhancing and easy to use. Realization of that vision will require companies, agencies and individuals to perform at a new level. The Requirements are our first step towards that goal, by describing a set of functions that parties must be able to fulfill, and a set of criteria for assessing those capabilities.

2.sec=The Requirements are an informed step forward in privacy, security, interoperability and usability based on the work of the IDESG's diverse membership of practitioners expert in their respective fields.

3.sec=Identity Ecosystem stakeholders can use the Requirements to identify and measure capabilities and services today and identify others to implement. The IDESG Framework includes guidance, listing and self-reporting facilities as part of the IDESG's Self-Assessment Listing Service (SALS). The SALS will support both informal and formal self-assessment. IDESG plans include an option to expand the program to third-party certification based on execution of the initial listing and IDESG’s outreach, activities and stakeholder input.
