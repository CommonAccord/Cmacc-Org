Ti=Requesting Party-Resource Server Operator: Is-Legitimate-Bearer

sec=When the Authorization Server issues an RPT to a Client and for as long as the RPT is valid, the Requesting Party using that Client gains an obligation to the Resource Server Operator to represent the legitimate bearer of the RPT or its authorized representative, and not to allow others to impersonate the Requesting Party.

Comments=In the case where the "bearer" RPT profile or any other bearer-style RPT profile is used, the token may not be bound in any technically confirmable way to the specific client and requesting party it applies to. Defining and using different UMA token profiles can mitigate the risk of failure or malice on the Requesting Party's part. The "authorized representative" phrase is intended to clear the way for token-chaining profiles or similar.
