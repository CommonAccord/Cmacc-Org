Ti=Authorizing Party-Resource Server Operator: Introduce-Authorization-Server

sec=When the Authorization Server issues a PAT to a Resource Server and as long as the PAT is valid, the Authorizing Party gains an obligation to the Resource Server Operator to introduce the desired Authorization Server to this Resource Server in outsourcing protection of this Resource Server's resources.

Comments=Once the Authorization Server Operator becomes the Authorizing Party’s authorization proxy, the Resource Server Operator begins relying on it in other, more specific ways. How the Authorizing Party indicated the desired Authorization Server to the host is out of band for UMA; it is the Authorizing Party's responsibility to check that it has been redirected to an acceptable Authorization Server before the Authorization Server successfully issues the PAT. This obligation can be removed through PAT revocation.
