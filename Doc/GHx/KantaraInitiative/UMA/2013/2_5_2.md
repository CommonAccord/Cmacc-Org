Ti=Authorizing Party-Authorization Server Operator: Introduce-Resource-Server

sec=When the Authorization Server issues a PAT to a Resource Server and as long as the PAT is valid, the Authorizing Party gains an obligation to the Authorization Server Operator to introduce the desired Resource Server to this Authorization Server in outsourcing protection of this Resource Server's resources.

Comments=How the Resource Server learned of the Authorization Server's location is out of band for UMA; it is the Authorizing Party's responsibility to check that it has been redirected to an acceptable Authorization Server before the Authorization Server successfully issues the PAT. This obligation can be removed through PAT revocation.
