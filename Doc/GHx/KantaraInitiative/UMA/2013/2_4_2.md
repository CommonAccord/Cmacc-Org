Ti={Authorization_Server_Operator}-{Resource_Server_Operator}: Follow-Policies-Accurately-and-Timely

sec=When the {Resource_Server} registers a requested permission at the {Authorization_Server}, the {Authorization_Server_Operator} gains an obligation to the {Resource_Server_Operator} to adhere to the {Authorizing_Party}’s authorization policies accurately and timely in associating authorization data with {RPTs} presented with the registered permission's ticket.

Comments=At a later stage, when a {Client} approaches the {Authorization_Server} presenting an {RPT} and a permission ticket, the {Authorization_Server} matches {Authorizing_Party} policies to the requested permission to drive any requests for claims and ultimate authorization processes, but its responsibility for performing this task begins now.
