Ti=Requesting Party-Authorizing Party: Adhere-to-Terms

sec=When the Client successfully gains access from a Resource Server to a protected resource by wielding a valid "bearer" RPT associated with at least one currently valid permission for the type of access sought, the Requesting Party using that Client gains an obligation to the Authorizing Party to adhere to any terms it agreed to in order to gain the permission.

Comments=This key obligation enables the end-to-end access authorization agreement that UMA exists to forge. At a previous stage, the Requesting Party asked for a relevant permission from the Authorization Server and might have had to provide claims of a promissory nature. Accepting access to the protected resource binds the Requesting Party to any terms it agreed to using the claims mechanism, for example, agreeing only to read the resource rather than modifying it, or forbearing from selling the resource data to someone else.

Issues=Note that the obligation goes into effect the first time a Client gains access under the power of a "currently valid permission". If there was more than one valid permission attached to different sets of promises, if a secure record was not kept by the Resource Server and/or Authorization Server of which permission was used for granting access, ambiguity is introduced. Defining and using RPT profiles other than the "bearer" profile might lessen the potential ambiguity.
