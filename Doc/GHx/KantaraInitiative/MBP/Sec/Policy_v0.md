Ti=Policy

0.sec=This section specifies principles and matters that do not fall neatly into either technical or organizational.  

1.Ti=Shard, guard, discard, recharge.
 
1.1.sec=We request only information that is necessary to the expected course of action and to branches where it is impractical to request additional information.  In our internal operations, we compartmentalize information so that we do not needlessly aggregate collections or provide unneeded access internally. 

1.2.sec=We diligently protect information using community best practices and updating frequently. 

1.3.sec=We discard and erase information when it is no longer needed or may be rerequested,

1.4.sec=We anticipate that information may be re-requested from the source  (app or person) from which we obtained it.
