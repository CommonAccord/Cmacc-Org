0.sec=This is an attempt to be fairly formal in the description of a CommonAccord solution that has access control and can work witha variety of platforms, including blockchains, git, IPFS and legacy systems.  The thesis of CommonAccord is that the <a href="index.php?action=doc&file=S/About/Conference/Stack/Hourglass_0.md">"generative" element for an open, peer-to-peer transacting platform</a> is a common record format. 

1.sec=We've only just started, but a place to start is <a href="index.php?action=doc&file=S/About/Conference/Stack/Cmacc_0.md">Cmacc</a>.  At the bottom of each page is a link to another part of the description.
