Ti=Contract

1.Ti=General

1.0.sec=A contract (in the legal sense) extends the notion of a <a href="index.php?action=doc&file=S/About/Conference/Stack/Legal/Record_0.md">Record</a>.

1.1.sec=The statements are often of the nature of price, quantities, dates, specific arrangements, etc.

1.2.0.sec=The context often is:

1.2.1.sec=two Parties (there can be more but can't be fewer); and

1.2.2.sec=a Form of contract agreement.

1.2.=[Z/ol/s2] 

1.3.sec=A contract must have signature - actual or a substitute.

2.Ti=Parties

2.0.sec=Parties are Persons.  They can be represented by Objects and included as context.

2.1.sec=A Party is an Object with attributes such as names, addresses, type (entity, individual, female, etc.) relationships. In some contexts it may be adequate simply to be able to identify the Party, rather than having to know much about their attributes.  This is the subject matter of "identity management." 

2.2.sec=As a convention, in a Record we might refer to Parties as "P1.", "P2.", etc.  Of course we can also refer to them by role, such as "Seller." and "Buyer.".

3.Ti=Form

3.0.sec=A contract Form can be formatted in various ways.  There are conventional format agreements (which vary somewhat from one language and tradition to another), letter agreements, notes, etc.  It may be convenient to start with the most formal because they are the most common.  An agreement can be understood as nesting:

3.1.sec=A root consisting of a Header, a Frame, a Footer and (optionally) attachments.

3.2.sec=The <a href="index.php?action=source&file=Z/Agt/Agt_v01.md">Frame</a> consists of a Heading, Sections and Signature.

3.3.sec=The Heading is a title and some summary information, a description of the parties, a statement that the document is an agreement, background, and an introductory sentence for the sections.

3.4.sec=The Sections are the meat of the agreement and commonly are an outline with subjects such as the business deal, conditions, representations, term, disputes, remedies and miscellaneous.

3.5.sec=Signature generally includes a statement referencing the agreement and has blocks for signature by each Party or their agent.
