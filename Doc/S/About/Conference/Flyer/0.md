Intro.1.sec=There is today a need for automation of a number of tasks relating to digital contracts.

Intro.2.sec=Models of digital contracts need to be readily available, be easily modifiable and be trackable across machine-to-machine automated negotiations. 

Intro.3.sec=Root contracts or "template" contracts based on the CommonAccord data model need to be available from public repositories, much like open source software today is available from various GitHub repositories.

Intro.4.sec=Privacy-preserving mutual access to private contracts repositories require new paradigms in distributed access control and consent management.

Intro.5.sec=The emergence of blockchain technology offers a low cost alternative to digital signatures for contracts, which have so far required centralized certificate authorities.

Intro.6.sec=Permissionless and permissioned blockchains allow for various degrees of non-repudiation for digital contracts to be achieved, and provide a low cost alternative for event reconstructability and the accountability of past contracts.
