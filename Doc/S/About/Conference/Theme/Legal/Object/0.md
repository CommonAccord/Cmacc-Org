Ti=Object Model for a Legal System

0.sec=The goal is to describe all of the pieces, relationships and features of the global legal system as "objects" in a graph of documents (nodes, edges and properties), such that any new document can be generated by referencing a few existing objects and adding the genuinely new elements.  "Object model" is a mouthful.  In the context of CommonAccord, it can be understood as the organization of files on a hard drive.

1.0.sec=At a basic level, the files can be something like:

1.1.sec=<a href="index.php?action=list&file=U/id/">Persons</a> (individuals, legal persons, roles and pseudonyms)

1.2.sec=<a href="index.php?action=list&file=U/at/">Places</a>

1.3.sec=<a href="index.php?action=list&file=U/is/">Properties</a>

1.4.sec=Forms <a href="index.php?action=list&file=Wx/">from websites</a> and <a href="index.php?action=list&file=GH/">from repositories</a>.

2.sec=<a href="index.php?action=doc&file=S/About/Conference/Theme/Legal/Object/Document_0.md">Documents</a> (including forms) can also have an object structure.

3.sec=<a href="index.php?action=doc&file=S/About/Conference/Theme/Legal/Object/Transaction_0.md"> Transactions</a> are collections of persons, facts, documents and events.

90.sec=We suggest <a href="index.php?action=list&file=">one organization of the folders</a>, but this needs much more attention.<br><br><img src="index.php?action=raw&file=S/About/Conference/Image/Legal_System_ObjectModel.jpg" height="500" width="700">
