Ti=Object Model for Legal Documents

0.sec=The goal is to build documents from kits of reusable parts.  This promotes consistency, comparison, codification and commentary.  It also makes the documents quasi-machine readable. 

1.sec=For instance, on a base of a <a href="index.php?action=doc&file=Z/Agt/Agt_v01.md">general frame of agreement</a>;

2.sec=Sections can be added <a href="index.php?action=doc&file=Wx/com/cooleygo/US/NDA/Form/0.md">to make a form NDA</a>; and

3.sec=The form can be used with deal information to make a <a href="index.php?action=doc&file=Dx/Acme/02-NDA-With-Quake/01-NDA_v0.md">a completed document</a>
