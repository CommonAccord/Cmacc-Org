Ti=Render (parameter)

1.Ti=Rendering is Expansion of a Value

1.1.sec=A "Document" is the result of rendering a "Record".

1.2.sec=Rendering is done by expanding the Value of a specified Key - by default it is currently "Model.Root" - with recursive expansion of {plugs} in the Value.

1.3.sec=Plugs are expanded by literal matching with the Plug name with the first matching Key name in the namespace of the Record.

2.Ti=The Key namespace of a Record

2.0.sec=The Key namespace of a Record1 is:

2.1.sec=the Keys in Record1,

2.2.0.sec=for each RecordN referenced as a Value in Record1 - the Keys in RecordN:

2.2.1.sec=If a RecordN is referenced by an empty Key, the Keys and Values are included as is.

2.2.2.0.sec=If a RecordN is referenced by a Key which has a name,  that name is "prefixed" to each of the Keys and the Plugs in RecordN.

2.2.2.1.sec=E.g., a reference Foo.=[Record2] means that a Key/Value in Record2 of "sec=My {Name}."  would be evaluated as Foo.sec=My {Foo.Name}.  

2.2.2.2.sec=If a Key called "Foo.Name" is not found, the prefix is removed and "Name" is tried.  This deprefixing is both (i) essential in many uses, and (ii) a consequence of the object model.

2.3.sec=recursively, depth-first.

3.Ti=Ordered versus Unordered List

3.0.sec=Currently, the order of Keys in a Record is significant.  

3.1.sec=A Record may contain more than one Key with the same name - the top one has priority.  

3.2.sec=It is common to reference a number of RecordNs via the same Key, notably with an empty Key.

3.3.sec=Multiple Key/Values is otherwise of minor use.

3.00.sec=It would be possible to develop a naming convention for Keys that indicated order.  For instance (1)=[High_Priority.md], (2)=[Next_Priority.md]
