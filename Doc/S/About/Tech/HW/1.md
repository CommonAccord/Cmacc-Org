Model.Root={HW}{!}

HW={H} {W}

H=Hello

W=World

Note=This shows the mechanics of expansion: <ul><li>Clicking on "Document" launches a parser.<li>The parser looks for a line that begins "Model.Root=".<li> It takes the right hand part (the part after the "=", e.g., "{HW}"), and treats that as the text of Document.<li>It looks for any "variables" -  strings of text bracketed by braces ("{" followed by a "}").  If there are any variables, it "expands" them by looking for a key with a matching name.  If it finds a key that matches, it makes the substitution.<li>It repeats until all variables have been substituted or been found not to have matching keys.<li>In the Document view, it returns the text of Document with each substitution marked with the name of the variable (do a mouse-over) and each unmatched variable highlighted in red.</ul>  <br><br>Next demo is how to include another file to access its key/values.
