Note=This file includes the other file.  When we view "Document," rendering looks for r00t=.  It looks first in this file, but doesn't find it.  Then it looks in the referenced file.  There it finds "r00t" and starts expanding.  But each expansion is done by looking first in this list.  So we can complete and we can override anything.
