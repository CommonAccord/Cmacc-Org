2.2.sec=<a href="https://github.com/CommonAccord/Site-Org/issues/38">GitHub issue thread on naming.</a>

2.3.sec=Jumping into multiple file systems.  <br>The most direct way is to use git to add folders of files. Your document environment is the files you clone to your repo.  <br>But a more advanced use would want to be able to override parts of that.  That overriding could be done in parallel to the way we handle overriding of key/values.  As each key/value in a file has higher priority than key/values in referenced files, so a reference to a file should be satisfied from the local file system, but if not found, then can be obtained from a referenced file system.  So, one could have a small file system of one's own stuff, and reference another file system as something like:<ul><li>CmA_=[[http://commonaccord.org/Doc/]]</ul>This would have the effect of including all the CommonAccord files with a prefix of CmA_.
