Codifying Relations in the New Landscape of AI and LLMs: 

A project to open source model licenses, particularly focused on AI/LLM uses.

There is great change and controversy in relationships among authors and creators, publishers and companies that are consolidating knowledge in AI/LLM models.  Litigation, legislation, investigations, strikes, licenses, terms of use are all being used to address parts of this.

This worldwide debate about the proper allocation of rights and responsibilities could be greatly enhanced by using open-sourced model clauses and documents to find patterns that work for the various actors and communities.   It would provide a clearer way to have the discussion, would allow greater nuance and adaptation, and would allow a much broader range of participants to work towards solutions.


A place to start is with current initiatives on data sharing, including those focused on AI/LLM uses.
