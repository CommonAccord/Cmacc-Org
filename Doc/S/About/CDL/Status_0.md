Ti=Status - Convergence of Blockchain, Legal and Access Security

0.sec=A number of currents are converging:

1.sec=Bitcoin has spurred interest in P2P transacting platforms.  Among many other efforts, the Linux Foundation's {HLP} brings together a large number of actors to agree on a common platform.

2.sec=CommonAccord has a data model (Cmacc) that can extend P2P solutions to all legal relationships and be a bridge for integration with legacy systems such as Word (legal), ECM and ERM.

3.sec=There is a strong tradition of legal codification via bar and trade groups, agencies and clinics, and now also legal "hackers".

4.sec=Decentralized access control based on OAuth and related technologies is widely used and well-understood.

00.sec=The combination of Blockchain/Cmacc/Access is ripe for open-source iteration.
