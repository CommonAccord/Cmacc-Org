In the event {_Site_Name} makes any changes or additions to the list of subcontractors, the current list is made available to {_You} at the web address specified above, thereby giving {_You} the opportunity to object to such changes by notifying {_Site_Name} promptly in writing within then (10) business days after any updates are made by {_Site_Name} to the list of subcontractors.
