The parties agree that the parties will notify each other of any dispute within {Dispute.Notice.Within.days} of when it arises, that the parties will attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration, that any arbitration will occur in {ARB.Seat.City} and that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of {ARB.Org}.

In any arbitration, the parties will not seek discovery from each other, and the arbitrator shall not allow parties to engage in discovery; rather, each party shall disclose the evidence supporting their positions at some mutually agreeable time and date prior to the final hearing.

Neither party will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by these Terms. The parties also agree not to participate in claims brought in an private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person, if the other party is a party to the proceeding. If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then that language shall be deemed to have been dropped from the Terms and the remaining obligations relating to arbitration shall continue in full force and effect.
