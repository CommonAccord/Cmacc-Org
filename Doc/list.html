Much of "the law" is a set of naming conventions for shared ideas. So is the web.<br>

   The top level expressed here is:<ul><li>

  "D" for your deals.  You will NOT share these publicly, of course. We use "Dx" here because the examples aren't real deals.<li>

"GH" is for GitHub repos.  "GHx" represents GitHub repos that we have imagined.<li>

  "Law" is an experiment with a fully codified approach to legal documents based on common outlines.<li>

  "P" is reserved for your private, preferred, proprietary materials.  You will want some place to keep your private forms, clauses, instructions, etc.<li>

  "S" for some shared materials, stuff thought common and codified.<li>

"U" means something like "you" and has info about persons and places.<li>

"W" is intended to denote a www. website.  "Wx" because not official.<li>

"Z" is little bits of infrastructure text.

</ul>

A place to start might be: <a href="index.php?action=list&file=Dx/Acme/">Acme</a>.
