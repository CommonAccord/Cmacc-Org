Much of "the law" is a set of naming conventions for shared ideas. So is the web.<br>
<ul><li>
  All of the shared "Prose Objects" are in the "G" folder.  G is for git, since each Prose Object is a separate git repository.<li>

The other materials are historic.  Some contain very interesting experiments about organizing and naming documents.  Some are collections of documents.  Most of them use older naming conventions and some are quite incomplete.
</ul>
